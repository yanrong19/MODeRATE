61,CS1010S,"No doubt that the SU policy did have an impact on more people failing/getting 0.  I’m sure nobody would contend against that.

There’s another factor, however.  Wasn’t there a legendary TA (IYKYK) that was super good and practically helped literally everyone, even those who weren’t under him.  This TA went above and beyond every semester, even creating extra help sessions and an entire telegram group to discuss. I heard last sem was the last one for which he continued with prof LWK.  I have also heard that for some reason, some of the other TAs are just very terrible. This star TA has practically carried the everyone else.  Shoutout to him.

Perhaps the key better performance is to look at the TAs first.  I don’t think Dr Ben Leong’s opinion is entirely accurate.","Similar, this came with a extra GE pillar we have to complete and with the change in curriculums and faculty combinations, we have to take some fluff mods and mods not directly related to one’s discipline (e.g the often cited DTK1234, HSI if I’m not wrong)

U seem to have failed to recognize this point as pointed out by u/steamedchickenfeet and only pointed that “oh now can s/u D, ez life”. It’s not like u can s/u every mod (since we only have 8 max and 5 expires by y1) and if u use every s/u, 
the CAP becomes volatile to later grades 

And now as noted by OP’s post, the bar to s/u is so low that if u didn’t fail, u can basically s/u, and if people determine from the start that they don’t want to do well for the mod for various reasons, they now just need to give the bare minimum to pass, when before the s/u change, one would to try for a minimum C which is harder. So although more lenient, the new policy kinda degraded the meaning of S/U and now it’s become an exploit of sorts. In the end, there is both gd and bad to be seen in the new system

That said, hope u have prepared for yr finals and all the best as well","Lmao same, I couldn''t understand shit so I couldn''t code for shit. It also felt annoying to see \[EASY\] then I''m like bro I can''t solve it and that \[EASY\] is just hella taunting.

402,MA1521,"To Prof if you read this ,

Please don’t be dejected if you see this, I can tell the effort you put in aka marking tutorials by hand even with your workload, really helps me learn how to properly write my math solutions out . For every mod there will always be cheaters, see the 1010 fiasco that happened on the news last year . 

But in my view what’s more important is that the students learn more than just formulas in math mods , which is nice with the inclusion of Theorems . While sometimes I have to rewatch lectures because I’m slower , it’s nice to understand why we use these in mathematics. 

My friends and I will still try our best for this mod even if the curve is a little skewed as personally grades aren’t everything  , eventually cheaters get caught whether it’s in NUS or the workspace where the consequences are even worst .

Feel free to pm, as I can share that while annoyed, not all of us are freaking out about those cheating","I’m at that point where I can’t tell whether if I’m just either really stupid and everyone is a math god from the fourth dimension or a good chunk of people are just cheating.

I’ve been watching khan academy videos, throwing most of my time into revision for math, practicing from the textbook, and still constantly get stumped by the questions prof throw at us. 

The recent exams has been a huge hit to my morale. Even if I do barely pass the paper, I know for a fact I’ll be the bottom 10% with how the bellcurve has been so far. 

I think the worse part was the recent emails where the prof stated the first 30 papers he marked he found a lot of answers that were similar, and he must have found a lot more since he mentioned that he’s gonna drop the investigation cause it’s just too time consuming.

Either everyone manage to solve it using the same method (which is possible since math is math, how many solution can u come up with), or everyone somehow manage to get the answer from the same source.

Please note I’m in no way blaming the prof here, he’s really trying his best but there’s only so much he can do alone and against 700+ students. He’s an extremely dedicated and amazing professor. He actually wanted to contact and interview all the students in question but I think there were just too many that he can’t do it.

Seeing the current bellcurve it feels like getting 80 won’t even be enough for a B. I know getting a C to SU won’t be too difficult, but it’s frustrating knowing that no matter how hard you try, there’s nothing that can be done since the grounds were never fair to begin with.

Edit: Prof sent an email to clear up a misunderstanding. He found scripts that were similar but is not trying to imply that there are maybe a lot of cheaters. He did contact some students due to the similarity and will try a new way of proctoring for the last exam that will hopefully deter some cheaters.","Have to disagree with you on this. Even with discussion, an exam is meant to be done primarily by yourself, with discussion meant to help you when you get stuck. It should be possible for a sizeable proportion of the cohort to finish the paper on their own.

Heck I rmb in CS1010S, or any other intro CS mod that the profs would be repeatedly emphasising that any discussion for missions or what not meant we discuss pseudo code or the way to attack the question, and then everyone goes and does the question themselves. From what you described, it seems that the only way to do well/decently is to have different people work on different aspects of the solution and then share their solutions. If people tried to say sharing answers like that constituted discussion, Prof Ben/WaiKay/any other CS1010 prof would give them a straight F and send them to Disciplinary Panel.

Unless the prof explicitly said beforehand that he set the paper so that students were meant to do it together, I feel it flies in the face of everything the SOC profs have been telling us about not plagiarising other’s code. Granted I did not take CS2100 that semester, but heck any student that failed badly has a valid reason (and should) raise it to the Faculty and School that they should not be penalised for doing an exam on their own.

Being allowed to discuss is absolutely different from people working on different parts and sharing their answers, and its pretty duplicitous if the prof said ‘discuss’ and not ‘work on it together’.",4.47,4,"14.75,8.72,19.95,23.55,33.03"

The Finance specialisation is only open to students enrolled in a BBA or BBA (Acc) degree.

However, as to whether you can take FIN4720 or not, you might want to note that to even take FIN4720, you need to clear FIN3701 and FIN3702, which has FIN2704 as a pre req and FIN2704 has ACC1701 as a pre req. So you are looking at 24 MCs worth of UEs just to complete that whole set of modules. You might want to consider if it is worth using that many UEs or do you even have that many UEs in the first place (seeing as you are looking to do a 2nd major etc.)

Also, [iirc non biz students can only take biz modules with a ''X'' at the end of the module code](https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/kpyxv7/can_nonbiz_students_bid_for_nonx_coded_mods/) (eg FIN2704X, DAO1704X). For the rest of the modules, you might be precluded from bidding for them. You might want to drop the faculty an email to check whether non biz students can actually bid for FIN4720, since it does not have a ''X'' in the module code.","Am doing a second major in business management and I’m from CNM. You can take modules w/o the suffix X eg MNO2705 or MKT3701. But when there is a X eg FIN2704X, you can only take those with the suffix X. All these will count towards your unrestricted electives. 

During your study at NUS, you can create your own double degree but you usually need to fulfil some prerequisites first - eg fulfil X number of MCs.

For me personally, I took DBA3702 as my 1st BA spec mod before taking the other BA mods. Would recommend you to take it 1st as well because you might end up taking BA mods that are taught in R subsequently and your knowledge from DBA3702 could prove useful in the future.

IT3010 is a module about databases/SQL. SQL knowledge isn''t really required in other BA spec mods so you do not necessarily need to clear it 1st, though I must say SQL knowledge is super important for Business/Data Analytics roles if you''re looking for internships in this field.","hey! I didn’t take DBA3813 so I won’t be able to advice for that but I took the other 3 BA mods together in the last sem!

I would say DBA3702 has a super steep learning curve if you don’t have much coding experience. Like another commenter mentioned, you should definitely take this module bcos I believe you’ll understand the rigour of BA after taking this mod. Project groups are chosen by the prof and imo it was very helpful because there are some who are better in coding in each group so we could learn from one another.

For DBA3803, ngl i struggled at the start more because of the prof than the content 😅 couldn’t really understand how he explained stuff and there were some math proofs which won’t be tested but still fundamental in understanding ML concepts. 

Last I checked sem 2 prof is different so I won’t be able to advice much but generally from what I heard, my friends really struggled with the sem 2 prof’s teaching style too. You’ll probably need to do alot of independent work to grasp ML concepts and it’ll be nice to have a friend in this mod.

Another commenter summed up IT3010 pretty well and imo, i think it might be the easiest BA mod you’ll ever take. The other 2 BA mods were so hectic for me that I barely felt any workload from IT3010.","honestly the 3 BA mods made this the most hectic sem I ever had HAHAAHAH + i was dumb to take nm2207 which was coding heavy too. I didn’t have any coding/cs background at all but i put in ALOT of hardwork into redoing questions from sectionals, attempting the whole group assignment (my grp rarely splits work) and rewatching whole ML sectionals a few times etc. All that plus a stroke of good luck that I was blessed with good groupmates :) imo i think i did really well too HAHAHAH 

The key is to be very consistent and keep practicing, don’t fall behind for any mod or it’ll be difficult to catch up

As for IT3010, maybe if I clarified things abit….from what we learnt, there are only a few ways to write queries 🤷🏻‍♀️ content covered was imo quite little so usually i find it sufficient to read lect notes and watch parts of the lect. There are only 2 graded assignments (just takes 1 day each to complete), 2 luminus quizzes and once in while we need to submit a short assignment for tutorials. As long as the query produces the right answer full credit is given, so I guess the differentiating factor would be the finals.

353,LAC2201,"hi! i was an exchange student who took an LAC mod for one semester at NUS. technically, the workload is very light, as the assignments are limited to: 

1. a few pages of workbook problems, due weekly (very easy, take like 20 min to complete. seriously) 

2. oral assignments scattered here and there (simply record yourself reading an assigned passage from
the textbook) 

3. a group project where you interview a native speaker (super easy and engaging, done in a fairly large group so the work is spread very thinly. for mine i literally only had to write 2 questions and then attend the interview) 

however, the work assigned will not teach you the language, nor will it guarantee your grade on the quizzes and exams. most of the students in my class would spend 0 time studying the language on their own and would only put effort towards the assignments, resulting in failing grades on the quizzes (our professor was literally shocked with the quiz grades and said it was the worst she’d seen in a long time). so basically, my point is that even though the workload is light, it is still incredibly time consuming to learn a language. especially if it is a language that you want to continue with to an advanced level. the course itself may not be that demanding in terms of assignments, but it will require hours and hours to keep up with the content every week and commit it all to memory. every week we had to memorize about 20-30 characters,  and on top of that there were grammar rules and concepts. and that was for the very first semester for absolute beginners. keep in mind that the content is (obviously) cumulative, so you need to make time for review as well as for the new content. 

the lecture is super valuable and engaging (4 hrs per week) and there’s lots of helpful practice provided so i really recommend participation. i would also recommend reviewing the content for the lecture before you attend. 

I would say I committed at least 30min daily to studying the language for a minimum of 4 hours per week, and I got 100% on every quiz and exam. Maybe that was overkill, but I personally wanted to learn the language rather than just obtain the credit for the course. 

so yeah, really it’s up to you how much effort you put into the course/ learning the language. you can probably get away with a lot less studying than I did, especially if your goal is just to pass and obtain credit. but basically, even though the assigned workload is ridiculously light, i think that the course is quite a commitment if you want to do well and retain the knowledge.","I’m a CS student, took the mod in y2s1 where I also took 4 other mods. 

The workload for LAC was definitely much much lighter as compared to the other mods that I was taking. Classes are 2 hours, twice per week. Have graded homework submission at the end of each chapter. They normally take 2 weeks to complete a chapter. There’s also a group project component where we need to interview a native speaker, it’s quite light and manageable. 

There were also quizzes and exams. They were quite low stake and I think median was around 60%. The assessments were all just what was taught in class, so if you study properly actually it’s not that hard to get around 80% and above.

As for the demographic of the students, I think most people have some background but not a lot. You can definitely do decently with some effort. 

Just to give a rough gauge, I had some basic background but not a lot. Spent roughly 1-2 hours weekly on the mod. Scored quite decently, so it’s quite manageable :)","Yes, I took 3201 and I plan to stop at 3202. Workload for 3201 is similar to lower level. But the difficulty is much higher imo. Which means I needed to spend more time on the mod. Still I think that as compared to other mods I was taking, the workload is still much much lighter. 3201 has essays component, bi-weekly assignments and a lot of conversations in Chinese. All the content were mostly delivered in chinese and roughly around 40% of the students can somewhat communicate in chinese already. Not sure if it’s just my class but there were lots of exchange students who already uses chinese at home. So yeah that’s the demographic. 

It depends on your level of competency, I feel like 3201 was much harder than 2201. Recommend to not take the mods every sem. You need time to practise especially for language mods. But yes, that’s just my opinion.",5.75,0,"1.75,3.26,24.56,18.55,51.88"
84,CS2220,"Hi, I took the mod last sem! The module goes through machine learning concepts so you will learn like feature selection, supervised and unsupervised learning and ways to improve a model. Like ML with case studies on biological data from research papers. We also learnt algorithms to get a best phylogenetic tree and string alignment for biological sequences. But, the prof (prof lim soon) did not go through the concepts in detail, so it requires quite a lot of self-learning if you are less familiar with stats / data sci concepts. I don''t think a lot of biology knowledge is needed because he does introductions.

 The more lab aspect of the module is in the assignments - where we use a software called Weka. Programming language - you can use any you want. I used Python''s Pandas package for an assignment to clean and merge CSV files with DNA data, then I had to use Weka after to apply the algorithms. There isn''t a lot of guidance for the practical aspects imo because the lectures are theoretical only, the tutorials are like short lecture quiz questions (lecture and tutorial was tgt in 3hr slot).

I think lecturer is not very clear when he explains because he skims over complex concepts, like many of the models and equations, so may need to be proactive to clarify concepts. Also, no midterms or quiz or tests so finals is a first experience of his testing style

Had to present a research paper in computational biology as a group at the end of the module. Quite tough but fulfilling when you understand the paper, though when we emailed him questions - he isn''t very willing to answer all if he feels that its on you to figure it out
 
Hope this helps!","Hmm im not very sure because I haven''t taken cs3244, but from what I heard about the mod, I think there is overlap but I would say that cs2220 is less math-focused and less in-depth. He tends to say that this is not a ML mod and so he won''t go in depth into certain topics, so e.g. Support Vector Machines, Hidden Markov Model, Random Forests etc are gone through conceptually and very quickly. So, even if there is overlap in cs2220,, you would need to in a way self learn the concepts to understand them properly. Also, the practical side of implementing ML algo is all done by Weka, so you don''t really learn the implementation aspect. So, I would say the cs2220 would be quite breadth focused in comparison - taking CS3244 before cs2220 would make your life a lot easier imo!",NULL,4.09,0,"7.5,7.5,12.5,27.5,45"

Numerator after differentiation is x^(2) = 2x and differentiation of integration from x to 3 of sqrt(t^(3)  \+ 9) will be just sqrt(x^(3)  \+ 9). Use product rule accordingly. 

Denominator have to remove the magnitude sign. Since x -> 3^(+), it means that x is > 3. Hence 3 - (something larger than 3) will equal to negative result. Hence, -(3-x) = x - 3. If you differentiate x - 3, it will be left with 1.

23,BT2101,"Hello! BT2101 has been revamped into an Econometrics Modelling module - while there is some form of math involved, they are not very intensive and can be mostly understood. It’s more important to understand the theories and concepts, as well as the interpretation of the results. It’s not a very challenging module, but the workload could be pretty heavy - in the first semester, there are 9 individual submissions (graded based on effort - as long as you don’t submit things that don’t make any sense, you will get the credit), 5 group assignments (really graded on accuracy), and also 8 optional assignments (but they’re really optional). You will also have midterms and finals. Prof Varun is an extremely good and clear prof, so if you’re willing to wait till your Y2S1, and pack a little more of your prerequisites in your subsequent semester, then go ahead. 

I haven’t seen Prof Sungyong taught the revamped module yet - so not sure if he’ll follow Prof Varun syllabus, but either way, from my experience, he’s really really very nice, at the cost that he can’t teach. It’s very common to find mistakes in his lecture notes that make it even more confusing, so expect a lot of self-studying as well.

The Econometric module covers fundamental statistics and the different regression specifications (e.g. simple, multiple, non-linear), threats to internal validity (when do we know these results can be used), and how to overcome these threats.

BT2102 doesn’t require much math, or any - at least back when I took it 3 years ago. You need strong logical skills for your SQL component though, but it’s nothing challenging.

The project is to find \*any\* dataset, form \*any\* hypothesis, and \*no\* grading rubrics given at all. You will be very confused along the way regardless of your grasp of concepts taught, because you do not know what professor wants.  
Even if you feel that you have a strong foundation in linear regression and statistics (i.e.: you can self-learn everything and grasp the concepts well), his exam paper is going to make you so confused that you do not even know what he is trying to ask. Awkward and misleading phrasing are going to be everywhere in the exam papers and slides.

32,BT4212,"Hello! I’ve taken BT4212 in the previous AY - the professor who has taught the module is Dr Jin Chen, who is extremely passionate in teaching the module. While all the lectures are uploaded onto Luminus and there are no live lectures (they are freshly recorded, and not a recycle of previous semesters), he has held true to his words that he will reply to any questions via email within 24 hours. I cannot exactly remember the weightage, but there are 4 assignments based on 4 different themes, 1 project (which frankly is the easiest BT project I feel I have ever done), and finals. He teaches extremely well and is able to illustrate his points easily (I have other BT modules that cover the same concept during the same semester - but really I could only understand Dr Jin Chen). His finals was considerably harder than the previous batch, probably due to home-based examination, but really it’s still very manageable.

For his assignments, it is done in Python and R - there is a recommended language for each assignment (e.g. Assignment 2 uses R, but Assignment 3 uses Python), but you can choose whichever language you are most comfortable with. If I did not remember wrongly, the 4 themes are “Introduction to SEO”, “Randomized Assignment”, “PageRank Algorithm” and “Machine Learning”.

Hope this helps you in your decision!

There is still no risk going, and they are relying solely on it being inconvenient to go to NUS on that day. This also unfairly advantages everyone for whom it is convenient to take the re-test on that day. They get a second try at the test basically for free. I felt using min and max was also unfair. One can score better than another in both tests, but end up getting the same score. I thought even taking a simple average would be better (it introduces risk and is also fairer). If they are afraid that people might not be able to pass due to low PE1 scores, there are more natural ways to make the higher score more significant (compared to just using max). For example, taking the average after raising the scores to higher powers comes to mind (e.g. ((PE1^4 + PE2^4 )/2)^0.25 ).

CS1231 teaches you how to do proofs as well as certain mathematical objects relevant to CS. Doing CS1231 can help you answer the true/false questions that usually come out in the exams because they will usually ask you to explain your answer through some basic proofs. Doing CS1231 may help you to better understand the proofs used to show why the algorithms work in CS2040. If you can understand better why they work, you may be able to understand better how to use them/modify the algorithms to suit your needs. It may also help you with understanding the data structures used in CS2040 because they are based on the mathematical objects taught in CS1231 like graphs. So CS1231 might be useful.

However, the proofs in CS2040 are usually pretty simple anyway. Also, they usually describe the basics of each new data structure whenever they introduce those anyway, though not as formally and not as in-depth. So CS1231 may not be very necessary.

Students still need to fit into the modular structure, take part in module activities, and work under the restrictions of the module. For instance, most of the modules in the OP seem to be limited to a certain agency (e.g. GEN2070 is limited to ComLink).

This is unlike the system in SMU which also gives academic credit for Community Service but seems to be much more flexible.

2. CS2102
If you are taking the mod under prof adi, be prepared to do a fullstack application with presentation as part of the second assignment. If you have friends who are good with fullstack webdev/does work in project, thats great. Possible extremely high workload. 



3. CS2105
This is pretty simple and if all you need is to read the legendary Topdown Approach textbook. Everyone I knew who completed reading the book at least once  got A+. Some level of preparation beforehand, but super easy once youre prepared.


4. CS2106
High workload and content. I strongly recommend everyone to take this mod with a friend if youre the kind who dont ask questions. The assignments are reasonable and doable but the mod covers a wide range of indepth content. Dont even try to study this last minute.


5. CS2107
Assignments are not so simple and are usually the most difficult part of this module. This means you need to spend a large amount of time between wk5 and wk13 to do all the CTFs. I''ll recommend you to do it dutifully because the CTFs have the greatest learning value in this mod. It is possible to study for finals only at the end. And please take the module under prof chang ee chien. 


6. CS2101
Presentation mod paired with 2103. First half is a project presentation with a randomly chosen team and second half is the presentation for your 2113 project. If youre good with memorising scripts and giving presentation it is quite simple. Classes are usually in the morning so you will have early morning physical classes should you choose to do 2103 and 2101 .


7. CS2103
Very content heavy all around. Word of advice, learn java and git before hand. Go through the past 2103 website and learn the whole content. Pray you get good team mates. This is the module that will take up all your time and make you suffer from insomnia or force you to code for 12 hours non stop without sleep. This is also the module that''ll make you consider if you want to become a SWE in future. 

Overall word of advice: Personally, i think all the 2Ks module are the most useful and most important in NUS CS. They are the requisites for many higher level mods and they set the foundation for many (if not  all) aspects of computer science. I dont want to scare you but how much you grasp the content for these modules will likely determine how good a CS student you are. If there is a time to start to push, it will be for these modules. 

I wish you happiness and best of luck.","St2334: Took it in sem 1 and i have honestly no idea what any of the profs are saying. The content is more or less the same as H2 math (stats part) so the workload isn''t that bad if u took that before.

Cs2103T: Took it in sem 1 and workload is manageable. Will need around an entire day of effort per week for the project. 

CS2101: Honestly an absolute waste of time. Not sure how it will be next sem when f2f lesson resumes but it was quite chill other than when we need submit all the reports and do oral presentation.

Cs2015: Have not took it but based on what my friends said, the workload is quite light and content is easy. Would recommend taking before CS2107 as around 2 chapter of CS2107 is on network security.

Cs2106: Took in sem 1 and work load is slightly higher than 2102 but lighter than 2103. The labs would take quite some time so have to start early. Content taught is relatively easy to me as well.

Cs2107: Took in sem 2 under Prof Chang. There''s alot of content but it is comes together after doing the ctf. Ctf will take up alot of your time.

85,CS2309,"Hey, I am one of the students in SoC who graduated this year under the Turing Programme.

1. I think around 7-15 students (Say ~3-5% of total CS cohort) go for Turing programme each year. From personal experience and what I have heard from seniors on this programme in the past, you need to ask for the invitation in some sense. Take CS2309 + CS3230 and hopefully get good grades in both. Then ask one of the profs of these courses or the prof with whom you are doing UROP to recommend you for the programme. They should know which prof/faculty member is the coordinator for the Turing programme at the moment and get your name in their purview. 

2. From what I know, no particular professor is assigned to you. General consensus around the programme is that people do it either to boost their future applications for grad schools or to get exempted from the 3k software engineering mandatory courses (by taking UROP instead). You can still obviously consider your UROP/FYP profs as mentors and take advice from them regarding grad school and in general know more about research/academic life in CS.

3. I think UROP has always been a consecutive two semester long commitment. You also probably want to do an FYP since that is also a requirement for the programme. So in total both these things together block 4 semesters. I would recommend to go for an SEP either in Year 2, or finish the UROP by Year 3 Semester 1 and go for SEP in Year 3 Semester 2. 
As for your last question, I would only recommend Turing programme if you are considering grad school and/or don’t want to do the mandatory 3k software engineering courses. Any other reason apart from these is probably not worth missing SEP over.

Hope this helps.","Getting good grade in CS2309 is pretty easy atleast compared to say CS3230. 

You can start UROP before CS2309, there is no rule against that. I did it myself too. Till the time your UROP professor doesn’t care about CS2309 (which most don’t) you should be good.

I don’t think you can get admitted into TP alone with CS3230. From what I know you need to have done CS2309, can try to check this detail with SoC admin office.

Anyways, if you are planning to do the 3K SE mods then getting in/not getting in TP is not as high stakes for you as it would be for someone else (since you are not dropping SE courses in the hope that you will be in the TP), so you can probably delay getting into the program till Year3/Year4.

UROP is quite dependent on your + the prof expectation. There is no pre-decided number of hours you need to spend and the profs are understanding enough to not expect work from your end during exam weeks etc. If you think it is a very heavy workload with all these things you can consider working on your UROP part time / full time during the summer/winter break as well which can reduce your workload during the semesters.","Largely depends on the professor you contact to do UROP under. If it’s a theory prof (algorithms or AI) then they might have expectation of you having done some math courses or CS3230 and might even request for your resume / transcript. 

For systems professors I don’t know what criteria they usually follow. 

But in either case I don’t think it is expected that you know anything about the research topic in specific just that the prof would like that you are passionate about the material and have taken + done well in courses related to that domain.",5.39,0,"10.03,2.01,9.7,13.71,64.55"

CS4226 - took this mod last AY. Also relatively chill. Course starts off pretty difficult, but it gradually gets easier. First part of the course is mostly about network performance and queueing systems (m/m/1), resource allocation. Thus, there are some probability requirements. Towards the later half of the semester, the topics are pretty much very simple (BGP, SDN and P2P). Mod is very easy if you have a strong probability background, since the last few chapters aren’t difficult to understand and PYP is available for practice too, so the bulk of the difficult content is in midterms and so long as you master that content it comes out for finals too.","CS4222 -  Took it last sem.

**If you see Prof. Seth Gilbert teaching a mod. Try sitting in or taking it.** This semester he should be doing **CS5234**.

See if you like the techniques, the approaches, the way that we solve problems here. It''s a very good taster for whether you will enjoy algorithms and theory. Maybe even eventually when given a chance, eventually take the module.

**If you want to do research eventually, consider the Turing Programme**. It''ll basically allow you to just do a UROP and an FYP for graduation requirements and other more research/theory related stuff. You can still take CS3203 for fun at that point despite not being a graduation requirement anymore and I''d still suggest you still take CS3203 or something so this is not too important, just weigh the pros and cons for yourself when it comes to it.

**As a general guideline for what math modules you might also want to take that might end up being helpful.** I would say calculus has never been too helpful for me. Though it might be in AI/ML or computer graphics. Basic linear algebra would be useful for computer vision and AL/ML as well if I recall correctly. ST2334 is probably most of what you need for algorithms in CS as well to be honest (but lacking for AI/ML). If you like, you could take some mod on algebra like MA2202 or even applied algebra (forgot the module code), and maybe the math mod on combinatorics and graphs. **As a general rule, you should assume taking math mods just gives you practice with formal proofs and mathematical thinking even though the tools in and of themselves will not usually be directly used (unless you''re doing really high level stuff).** I''ve only had to invoke bigger math theorems when taking CS4Ks in theory/algorithms modules and even then most of such modules are self contained. Bottom line being, if you really want to also take math modules on the side, you can try **MA2202 - Algebra I, MA2214 - Combinatorics and Graphs.** These would probably yield most direct utility. If you really wanted, you could also try for **MA2202 - Linear Algebra II, MA3201 - Algebra I, MA3205 - Set Theory, MA4207 Mathematical Logic.** The final mod there having some very intricate links to ideas in theory of computation actually.

**If you see Prof. Seth Gilbert teaching a mod. Try sitting in or taking it.** This semester he should be doing **CS5234**. You probably would not have the background but I would encourage you to sit in or find a way to audit all the same. Understand that you might not be able to completely understand all the idea but the Professor does an amazing job conveying algorithmic ideas, and that''s something you can get exposure to. See if you like the techniques, the approaches, the way that we solve problems here. It''s a very good taster for whether you will enjoy algorithms and theory.

94,CS3235,"Okay, here’s what happened: grading of the module this semester was 70% CA + 30% midterm.

The 70% CA was comprised of 40% coding project and 30% “weekly homework’s” (Quiz on LumiNUS), and although some parts were challenging you were almost guaranteed to score full or close to full marks here, which led to a super steep bell curve.

Coding projects were CTF style. The first coding project was about web vulnerabilities which was pretty doable, second coding project was about memory vulnerabilities which was quite a bit more challenging, but more or less still doable for most. For the quizzes, there were multiple submissions allowed for some of them (with feedback given after each submission). So more or less the 70% CA were free marks for almost everyone.

The 30% Midterm was challenging, though. Most people (I know anyway) could not score well for the Midterm, given that it also had an interesting section where you work with large numbers for cryptography during the exam itself (so there may be some coding involved depending on the tool you used e.g gmpy2).

A lot of the sourness with the module this semester involved “fairness”: the midterm, where that was one big saga by itself with a number of people in the class requesting a re-test. Given that 70% of the module was CA, the midterm would have played a significant part of contributing to your grade.

Another one involved the 2nd coding assignment: when people requested an extension to the deadline, some others were not pleased by the extension and started resorting to posting on the forum about how “it was not fair” for a deadline extension given some people had worked many nights to meet the deadline. In fairness, there was a problem with the auto-grader and that was the reason cited for the extension.

Prof also posted in the Forum about how grades worked in NUS, which I guess also did not sit well with some people so there’s also that.

Honestly, despite all that said, I’ve learnt a lot from the module this past semester and I’d just advice to ignore the sour grapes and be responsible for your own learning haha :).","I don’t have experience with China Universities, but I have mapped SoC modules to Taiwan universities in which the modules are taught in Chinese! It was approved by NUS haha, but COVID happened and I didn’t get to go. I believe the same goes for China universities - you should be able to take mods in Chinese.","You’re welcome! Haha I mainly map my own major’s modules - BT4221 (Big Data Techniques & Technologies), IS4241 (Social Media Network Analysis), BT4015 (Geospatial Analytics) and some economics/marketing modules.

Hmm actually SoC isn’t really strict - I have my IS4241 mapped to a journalism module there because the module title is very similar, but the content is pretty different!

95,CS3237,"GEC1030 was by far my favourite (and the easiest) module I took this semester.

The best part is that all lectures are webcasted and there are two benefits to this:

1.	You can watch them whenever you want
2.	You don’t have to watch all of them for your graded work

Your final grade will only be based on 3 individual assignments and class participation in tutorials. No exams or group projects though there are some fun group discussion in class. There are readings but they’re very short and honestly you don’t actually *need* to read any of them.

For the graded individual assignments, you can start them as early as you want and get it over with since the lectures from the first six weeks will be available from Week 1 and the rest will be available by Recess Week.

For each of the assignments, you just need to pick a city and write 1) an image response, 2) a documentary response, and 3) a final project. They’re all pretty short and sweet but this doesn’t mean you can completely slack off because the bell curve will be pretty steep!

If you really want to put minimal effort, you can do what one of my classmates did: he watched the lectures and read the readings for Week 5 and wrote all three assignments on one of the cities from that week. He finished all three assignments by the end of recess week.

Personally, I enjoyed watching every lecture and reading every assigned reading because the content is genuinely interesting. So, if you’re a history enthusiast, this is the perfect module to learn and not worry too much about grades.

The professor is also super funny and really sweet. She makes learning about history engaging through personal anecdotes and storytelling. Be sure to chat with her beyond coursework if you’re actually interested in the history of cities!

Hope this helps and safe travels to Singapore!","Irrelevant, but damn cs mods for exchange, haffun man :’)","Luck module (GEC1028) was a fun mod, prof GG is a great teacher that had to make do with the lack of response in zoom lectures, overall content is interesting and makes u think abt the role of luck in life

Readings are average for a GE/arts mod, exams are based on core concepts found in the readings 

Not particularly difficult unless one is trying for A, which requires a deeper understanding of how the concepts were applied and which are used in which context

96,CS3240,"Hey there! IMD Minor here, I can chime in. (Long post warning)
For UI/UX specifically, there are a few you can take: NM2213, NM3221, CS3240, NM4249.
NM2213: light project (simple prototype using Miro), more theory-focused
CS3240: heavy++ workload, project using Figma (will be taught+Figma is industry standard), open-ended project.
NM3221: Mobile app project using Figma (Didn''t take)
CS4249: More in-depth into UI, have to code a working interface. (Didn''t take)

The normal route that most IMD minors go is taking CS3240. However, NM2207 is a pre-requisite for that module, unless you''ve taken the other pre-requisites (Do check!). I have friends who have written in to take NM2207 despite having taken CS1010 before, so you can try. CS3240 revolves around a group project prototyped using Figma (No coding required). The lectures are quite dry but you''ll learn plenty from hands on. The workload is very high so I''d suggest taking it with lighter modules. Find a group to do it with, as I was really successful with my group of friends (You can pick groups)! I really enjoyed this module despite the workload. On a personal level, it has inspired my pursuit of UI/UX.

I loved NM2207 tho for most it''s a hard module. You don''t get a lot of opportunities to learn HTML CSS and Javascript in school. Try to write in!

As a CNM major, I took NM2213 before CS3240, and the theory/lecture content is roughly the same, though CS3240''s approach is a little more practical. It can help to take NM2213 beforehand, which most CNM-IMD minors do anyways. This one has a light project because the pace is slow and you stop at low/mid fidelity prototype. Be wary of the 2 tests, so do take note of the theory.

I won''t be taking NM3221 because I''ve already made a mobile app using Figma for my CS3240 project. I feel I won''t learn much more from NM3221. I can ask my friend who take it if you need. You can still take it though, he says it''s a really good module. 

NM3217 and NM3230 are not super relevant. I would still take NM3217 as it''s a very fun module, teaches you design principles, vector graphics, plus Adobe suite, and may translate well into UIUX design. NM3230 is for video production using Premier Pro and is a good skill to have but not as relevant as the other mods to UIUX.

CS4249, as I hear, does have a project where you are required to code an interface which is a step above what we''ve done in the previous 2k and 3k modules. Not everyone in the group needs to code, just at least 1 person. Sorry to the one that has to code. The evaluation and surveying of your prototype is also more advanced. I don''t plan on taking this, instead I will take CS4240, so I cannot help much on this. But most IMD students take CS4249.

The other mods not mentioned aren''t really available anymore, sadge.

You can DM me for resources on the mods I''ve taken. I''m also working on module reviews for them, which will be on NUSMODS once they''re up. Whew, this was a long read!","Not sure about pre-requisites and what not but I''ll share some thoughts on NM2213 and NM3217.

Personally I really enjoyed both modules thoroughly so just note I MAY be a bit biased.

NM2213: This was a bit more theory-based than I expected, with a midterm and a final. However, being someone that usually doesn''t like theory heavy content, I really enjoyed the content taught. I took this two semesters ago and had two quizzes, two short essays that basically get you to apply the content taught in lecture, and lastly a final project that has weekly milestones. For the first half of the semester you''ll be working on those essays, discussing with your groups and brainstorming dueing tutorial, before you choose to focus on a topic and write. After that, you''ll be working on a final project (for me it was designing the UI/UX of a Video conferencing platform). For tutorials you''ll be presenting whatever you done for that week and then discuss with your group after you get some feedback. Overall workload wise I think it''s manageable unless you get a shit group then prepare to do some heavy lifting.

NM3217: I loved this module. Workload the first half is pretty much nonexistent, with tutorials going through how to use the different Adobe programmes. After that, workpoad gets quite heavy with weekly submissions but it wasn''t anything overly stressful if you pace yourself well. We had to do a 1) Abstraction exercise, 2) Photo Storyboard and 3) An Infographic, before the final big project where you do a self branding guide or one for CNM. I really liked how you essentially have the freedom to do whatever you want for the assignments. For tutorials you''ll be presenting the 99% completed version of your work and gathering feedback for you to make any tweaks before your submission a couple days later. You can search NM3217 blog to get a feel for what the module entails.

Also, I was taught by Professors Alex and Kai En, and they were both fantastic and definitely contributed to making the modules a lot more engaging. Sorry for the lengthy post but feel free to reach out if you have any other questions!","Not sure abt last sem, but this sem the workload I felt was manageable.

The final Indv assignment were just 10 mcqs that took an hour to finish. If the assignment was heavier I would have just passed away already.

And the final grp proj portion was just coding some triggers and procedures. They were a little tricky but my team and I started early and was able to finish it in a few days since we made sure to split the work evenly among us.

Compared to cs2103 and cs2101, cs3240 or st2334, the workload for cs2102 didn’t feel as heavy and we were given plenty of time for the assignments :”) The prof even extended the due date for the grp proj.

CS4226 - took this mod last AY. Also relatively chill. Course starts off pretty difficult, but it gradually gets easier. First part of the course is mostly about network performance and queueing systems (m/m/1), resource allocation. Thus, there are some probability requirements. Towards the later half of the semester, the topics are pretty much very simple (BGP, SDN and P2P). Mod is very easy if you have a strong probability background, since the last few chapters aren’t difficult to understand and PYP is available for practice too, so the bulk of the difficult content is in midterms and so long as you master that content it comes out for finals too.","CS4222 -  Took it last sem. In the beginning, the lecture content is more about an overview and the basics of wireless communication, so it is easy. While after recess week I believe it becomes pretty content-heavy. Need to fully understand many protocols for localization, discovery, MAC and routing. Fortunately, the math is relatively simple and the final is open book. Prof and TA are all very nice and patient and the project is not hard and quite fun. Overall a good module to take if you are interested in communication protocols or devices like SensorTag.

Just to add on, CS3203 would also demand a lot of your time if the team dynamics aren''t good, which might possibly lead you to sacrificing your other modules. Since the requirements for the project are already set, it is important that you are 100% familiar with them if you wanna do well. As for CS3281/CS3282, since it''s split over 2 semesters, the workload definitely won''t be as heavy as 3203 for a single semester. Plus, they build upon CS2103 knowledge and they are coordinated by the same prof so if you truly enjoyed CS2103, i think these 2 mods would enhance your knowledge greatly.

Just to add on, CS3203 would also demand a lot of your time if the team dynamics aren''t good, which might possibly lead you to sacrificing your other modules. Since the requirements for the project are already set, it is important that you are 100% familiar with them if you wanna do well. As for CS3281/CS3282, since it''s split over 2 semesters, the workload definitely won''t be as heavy as 3203 for a single semester. Plus, they build upon CS2103 knowledge and they are coordinated by the same prof so if you truly enjoyed CS2103, i think these 2 mods would enhance your knowledge greatly. In terms of the group size, i think the group size for 3281 is definitely smaller (maybe just 2 or 3 in a team).

tldr; if you didn''t enjoy 2103 or just want to clear the 8MC requirement asap, take CS3203. If you enjoyed 2103 and want to work on projects that are currently used by many others  (such as TEAMMATES), 3281/3282 would be great.",5.46,0,"19.8,3,6.8,17.6,52.8"

first part is on queuing theory, where you will need a pretty decent understanding of Poisson distributions. The module only covers M/M/1 queueing model, but covers it in detail. this part extends to recess week.

second part you will go into topical learning of more modern networking concepts like bgp routing, p2p networks and sdn.

assignment is on sdn, this one just search for cs4226 on github and you will get an idea of what will be done. (this is the only coding involved in the mod)

Definitely expect 3240 kind of standard, but more focused on quantity than quality of user experience. So what i mean is that there will be more statistical analysis and showing your findings between your chosen app and the proposed prototype.

At the end of the day, its really what your goal is. For me it was UI/UX and CS4249 definitely helped me for that. Hope it helps!","Took both 4240 and 4249. 

4249 is pretty much as /u/Willistay described, it felt more like a mini stats/science mod than anything CS - likely only need to make a basic front-end for stats logging, which you can leave to 1 or 2 of your groupmates to do. Very much a too many cooks spoil the broth situation. Otherwise, prof had pretty chill and interactive lectures as far as online lectures went, and would definitely recommend it for everyone, CS student or not.

4240 I absolutely do not recommend if you''re not able to code - the assignments basically require you to learn Unity and learn how to debug the damn VR headset not working etc. The final project could also potentially be extremely code heavy depending on what your team chooses.

If you are willing to learn how to essentially do game coding (or already know), 4240 is a free VR headset loan for the sem and is an absolute blast if you have a good enough PC at home.

In terms of learning, I can echo /u/Willistay - it''s more of an intro to developing in AR/VR, how to deal with motion sickness, what to avoid while to designing UIs in AR/VR applications etc. For the latter, I would say it needs a good understanding of how 3D games/applications are built to even know *how* to apply what is taught.

In summary, 4240 is a fun but somehwat workload heavy way to clear your 4k reqs but don''t expect to learn much if you''re already familiar with 3d/game dev. If you don''t have to clear a CS 4k and you can''t code, avoid.","i''m not sure what experience you had for your prereq for this module, but this mod focuses alot about comparing between different prototypes, statistics and survey feedback.

Gathering insights on your prototypes really show which prototype is statistically better. And the tools you are using are quite relevant IMO, like Qualtrics, JMP, AmazonTurk etc.

I didnt manage to land any intern on UI/UX so i cant say how much it helps in UI/UX, but taking this mod and CS3240 really helped me better understand UI/UX alot more.

Gathering insights on your prototypes really show which prototype is statistically better. And the tools you are using are quite relevant IMO, like Qualtrics, JMP, AmazonTurk etc.

I didnt manage to land any intern on UI/UX so i cant say how much it helps in UI/UX, but taking this mod and CS3240 really helped me better understand UI/UX alot more. I would say it was one of the more enjoyable mods in CS. I personally take quite an interest in design so i really enjoyed this mod.",7.01,0,"23.75,1,18.39,18.06,38.8"
117,CS4268,"# Oh Yeah, Forgot To Mention What You Should Pay Special Attention To

In case you do want to spend more time in this area there are a few things that I should probably mention that might be helpful.

&#x200B;

**If you see Prof. Seth Gilbert teaching a mod. Try sitting in or taking it.** This semester he should be doing **CS5234**. You probably would not have the background but I would encourage you to sit in or find a way to audit all the same. Understand that you might not be able to completely understand all the idea but the Professor does an amazing job conveying algorithmic ideas, and that''s something you can get exposure to. See if you like the techniques, the approaches, the way that we solve problems here. It''s a very good taster for whether you will enjoy algorithms and theory. Maybe even eventually when given a chance, eventually take the module.

**If you want to do research eventually, consider the Turing Programme**. It''ll basically allow you to just do a UROP and an FYP for graduation requirements and other more research/theory related stuff. You can still take CS3203 for fun at that point despite not being a graduation requirement anymore and I''d still suggest you still take CS3203 or something so this is not too important, just weigh the pros and cons for yourself when it comes to it.

**As a general guideline for what math modules you might also want to take that might end up being helpful.** I would say calculus has never been too helpful for me. Though it might be in AI/ML or computer graphics. Basic linear algebra would be useful for computer vision and AL/ML as well if I recall correctly. ST2334 is probably most of what you need for algorithms in CS as well to be honest (but lacking for AI/ML). If you like, you could take some mod on algebra like MA2202 or even applied algebra (forgot the module code), and maybe the math mod on combinatorics and graphs. **As a general rule, you should assume taking math mods just gives you practice with formal proofs and mathematical thinking even though the tools in and of themselves will not usually be directly used (unless you''re doing really high level stuff).** I''ve only had to invoke bigger math theorems when taking CS4Ks in theory/algorithms modules and even then most of such modules are self contained. Bottom line being, if you really want to also take math modules on the side, you can try **MA2202 - Algebra I, MA2214 - Combinatorics and Graphs.** These would probably yield most direct utility. If you really wanted, you could also try for **MA2202 - Linear Algebra II, MA3201 - Algebra I, MA3205 - Set Theory, MA4207 Mathematical Logic.** The final mod there having some very intricate links to ideas in theory of computation actually.

&#x200B;

Lastly, about grades. **Your grade for a semester is just an indication of how well you''ve performed in 4 months.** If you don''t do well for a module, it''s not the end of the world. You can go back and revise the ideas, and continue to work on them. No one should be judged on how well they can do something forever just based on the span of 4 months. **I got a B in ST2334** and subsequently went on to get **A-/A/A+** in **CS4/5/6K** modules for algorithms that needed knowledge on probability and statistics. Point is, if you get a bad grade, don''t let that dissuade you. If you''re willing to work on it and polish up your skills, at the end of the day it''ll be to your benefit.","Ah well unfortunately, while I may not be in the CS-Math DDP, I''m actually still in a DDP, just a different one. I don''t have much room for extra mods so it''s either I choose from either or I do both but overload. I''ve already overloaded a lot in my first few sems so I am a bit unwilling to do any more of such sems haha. I was kind of thinking that I do the SWE route, not the Turing programme, then for research experience, I just ask some profs if they want me as an RA. So rather than having the UROP as part of my curriculum, it''s outside of it. But I don''t know, I''m still thinking through my options lol

And don''t worry about me not taking CS3231. What I meant was if I decide not to push through with it, I would take CS2309, but only this sem. While I think I may not be interested in algo and theory research (unless taking this focus area eventually changes my mind and I think it might), I definitely want to take CS3231 eventually. To me, it''s weird the Halting problem and Turing machines are taught in depth only in an optional mod like CS3231 even though I feel it should be something CS students should learn more about.","Hmm not really. I''ve even had to take modules related to quantum information and I''d say the only overlap is the fact that they use Bra-Ket notation. The concerns with how CS uses these things vs Physics is quite orthogonal.

&#x200B;

As a classical counterpart, imagine how an EE engineer worries about getting the right voltages or currents or has to worry about noise and bouncing signals through a wire etc. A CS person just pretends 5V (or nowadays 3.3V) is a 1, and a 0V is a 0, and we start working from there.

&#x200B;

Taking the QM mods out of interest is still definitely something I''d recommend. Take modules that you like! But it will not be helpful.",4.11,0,"12.96,3.32,18.94,23.26,41.53"

1. EC1301: Easy workload, Medium content (if you don''t have Econs background), Easy exam. Probably the same to other preclusions. The MCQ exams are really doable and they even allow open-book. The trick here is to compete with the bell curve - getting >90% in total might not even get you A since the mod is not difficult, and careless mistakes can be quite brutal to your final grades.
2. ACC1701X: Medium-Easy workload, Medium content, Medium-Hard exam. Probably my personal opinion but I was super at lost at the first few weeks of the semester, but it gets better on as you get to understand things deeper. The projects are quite manageable although I''m not sure how I did for it. The exam is doable for MCQs but are seriously wtf for the essay questions, it''s like they intentionally make it difficult to balance the numbers out.","Took ACC1701X a couple of semesters ago. The concepts were easy and intuitive if you understand it, and they build upon each other, so you kinda need to stay on-the-ball with them. If you''re unsure about something, you''re pretty much gone for that chapter, so it''s pretty important to truly understand what it''s trying to teach.

I felt like the concepts were quite manageable for me (had to find external sources to help understand some concepts) until about week 9 or so, then it felt like I hit a wall and had to pump in extra hours to figure some stuff out.

Workload during the sem isn''t too much, just need to put in sufficient effort to stay up-to-date with the concepts to avoid having to rush everything last minute (which could be a 3000 or 30 IQ play depending on how well you cope with such situations, but I wouldn''t recommend risking it).

I believe you are reading the NUSMods prereq tree. As stated on NUSMods:

> The prerequisite tree is displayed for visualization purposes and may not be accurate. Viewers are encouraged to double check details.

If you read the prerequisites for the module, the prerequisites are: (I''ve added paragraphing for clarity) 

> {GEA1000 Quantitative Reasoning with Data or GER1000 Quantitative Reasoning or DSA1101 Introduction to Data Science or DSE1101 Introductory Data Science for Economics or ST1131 Introduction to Statistics and Statistical Computing} and 
>
>MA2401 Introductory Mathematics with R 
>
>MA2401 may be replaced by three modules as follows:
>
> - One module from MA1101R, MA1311, MA1508E, MA1513, or MA2001; and 
>
>- One module from MA1102R, MA1312, MA1505, MA1507, MA1511, MA1521, or MA2002; and
>
> - One module from MA2216/MA2116/ST2131 or ST2334

As such, you can fulfil prereqs with just GEA1000 and MA2401.

Wrt DSA3362, it is actually on NUSMods here: https://nusmods.com/modules/DSA3362/predictive-data-analytics

The reason why you probably couldn''t find it was because DSA3362 is not offered this AY and the default search filters of NUSMods only show modules offered this AY

Lastly, as an Economics major, note that MA2401 precludes your core module EC2104. Refer to https://fass.nus.edu.sg/ecs/requirements-for-economics-major/ for more details.","No

Depending on your level of programming background, EC3305 is either a very simple module (especially if you have taken a CS1010-variant), or a very difficult one that you might have to invest considerable amount of time into. The module is taught in R, with an emphasis on how to work with datasets and clean them (since that is what you will usually use R for in an econometrics context, besides of course data viz and statistical analysis).

The first half of the module focuses on programming fundamentals (primitives, data structures and control flow statements), while the second half focuses more on more advanced techniques using the tidyverse packages and some basic regex. As far as I recall, data viz and regression is covered but not tested (but it could be different for your batch). 

I would say that in order to do well for this module (especially if you come from little to no programming background) it is important to practice a lot.

the mod was split into 2 parts with each part having its own programming assignment in matlab. assignment wise is quite doable as it’s googleable, part 1 assignment i found the matlab commands i wanted from fundamentals of digital image processing a practical approach with examples in matlab (one of the reference books for part 1) 

part 1 is liek a more introduction i guess to image processing with focus for the exam on 2d fourier transform for images. part 2 was on edge detection and segmentation, morphological processing and image compression. 

part 1 is taught by prof ong sim heng and i felt like for part 1 you just need to be able to do fourier transform and how to calculate the resultant image data intensity values when a mask is applied to it.

part 2 was taught by prof wang xinchao, content wise it’s kinda a lot for part 2 imo so prof wang told us like what he won’t test.

both profs use a lot of examples to help in understanding the content which helps a lot. for part 2 i didn’t revise much cos prof wang emphasises on the examples so much that you end up memorising what he says. there’s no pyp released but if you understand the underlying concept tutorial qns are enough. 

iirc finals was 4 structured qns 2 for each part and mcq qns. part 1 tested fourier transform. part 2 was on hough transform application and mcqs i found for some was stuff that was discussed in lecture for part 2 but focussed on application of theory learnt.

There is always e-assignments reading to supplement your learning and I think weekly quiz (if I rmb correctly, they r not counted in grades). Its quite low effort for this, just that need discipline to read lol

171,EG1311,"Hi, I''m not too sure about the entry requirements like whether it has a minimum cap. Iirc it does have a quota and especially on mech eng students (i heard as rumor, not too sure, but i mech eng n got in anyway, so dont worry about it). 

I think iDP could suit you based on your interest in those mods. In many of the mods that I have taken, they involve both hands on and entrepreneurial aspects but the hands on part comes after design thinking process which they emphasize heavily on. It also involves a lot of writing (my nightmare).

Also, many iDP mods involve group works. If you do not enjoy group work, it may be something you would want to take into account when considering this second major. 

iDP has heavy workload, so I think you should consider whether you are ready to handle it or not. I would say that iDP mod took 40 percent of my efforts while the remaining goes to the other mods, so they are really time and effort consuming. Without iDP, I would have more rest time.

Some may say it''s not worth the effort but I think it''s based on what you get out of it. So I would suggest you to just try, can drop if you really don''t find it appealing to you. 

Lastly, I think the iDP Students Club is going to have a talk about the major (not sure when, just that I attended something like this b4), so can ask more detailed questions there. Your experience may be different from mine cuz the syllabus/timeline changed.","hi! am going onto year 2, but based on your cohort''s [recommended timetable](https://share.nus.edu.sg/engchbe/stu/Policies/Recommended%20Schedules/Direct%20Entry%20Students/Direct%20Entry%20Students%20AY2020-2021.pdf) (you need NUS VPN to access this-- if you''re not sure how to, i can PM you the file via tele or smth), i think your 1st year will be a lot like mine.

your core mods will be preallocated; you don''t have to worry about bidding and securing them or particular tutorial/lab sessions. in other words, most of your timetable (particularly: in sem1, 4 mods i.e. 16 out of the 20 MCs single degree holders usually do per semester) would have been settled for you. among these 4 preallocated core mods for sem 1, EG1311 will be one of them, like you said. you''ll probably have to request to drop the module on Edurec once Round 1 of modreg bidding opens, in addition to bidding for an unrestricted elective (UEM) and a module to replace EG1311.

i''m not sure if it''s possible to take a core engin mod outside of the usual semester you and your fellow course mates are meant to take it, but you can try taking CS1010E in sem 1 instead of 2. as it is offered by school of computing, there may be f2f tutorials or practical exams you should check for. you can also consider taking another GE mod in sem 1-- there are plenty to choose from & likely at least one that fits your needs & interests.

note that CN1101A, which all Y1 ChE students are required to take in sem 1, is heavily lab-based, so you might have labs even if you drop EG1311. hope this helps!","I took the same modules and totally agree with what the other commenter said.

>The module is quite rigorous and would require you to do work in Mechanical, Electronics and Robotics Middleware (ROS). It is not easy and will require a lot of time and effort and your end.

I actually enrolled for both sems officially but in the end I did not complete both becuz I dropped out from the sem for both… Took LOA effectively for entire sem for both sems. In the end… The LOA was for some reasons la so yeah haha

But sem 1 I still had access because of some “loophole” - I was still enrolled under “class groups” or something like that on the LumiNUS mod becuz of the studio group and project group

Anw by end of week 1… ur grouping alr settled.. so yeah… but for last sem.. I also ended up taking a LOA.. probably for a unrelated reason or reasons though","I took this mod in the first semester - so it was pretty clear that we were going to be the guinea pigs. I still enrolled even knowing this because I used to intern at the Centre for Liveable Cities and I heard my Executive Director was retiring and pursuing a part-time teaching career through this module. I''ll try to be as impartial as possible in describing my experiences. For background, I''m an engine student and I got an A for this module.
  


(Workload): It was pretty much all CAs. Most of the module weighting lies in the main project that spans across all 5 studios sessions - you are given a particular site/region, where you begin to explore it within your group and develop urban solutions around it. Everyone will be in groups with a mixture of students from different majors/faculties as y''all are supposed to role-play different stakeholders and co-create policies/solutions together. Most of the time spent on this module lies in the self-study within your groups for the main project and the biweekly lectures. Additionally, there are also a few quizzes that''s pretty easy to do, and no one studies for them.


  
(The good): If you are looking for exposure to urban governance, this might be interesting for you. In most lectures, Prof Khoo invites pretty important people (higher ranking peeps) in the public sector to speak about certain topics such as Conservation, Water, Parks, etc. It''s pretty insightful and rather accessible since it''s pretty much a 2-hour long storytelling session. There''s often a fair amount of QnA with these guests at the end of every lecture. Also, the studio sessions are usually accompanied by some of these “important” people who tend to lead most of the discussions – so it might be meaningful if you would like to listen to their very personal opinions.


  
Also, the main project can be good for your schedule since you are granted a long 3 weeks to sort out content within your group and present it during the studio. We are given lots of flexibility and freedom (possibly too much) to create and develop any kinds of solutions we want, and in whatever ways we want to. I have heard pretty wild shit that my schoolmates have proposed which they defended with much gumption. Very interesting stuff.


  
(The bad): I think this module lacks structure. The connection from class materials to lecture to studios seem rather vague and unclear. Expectations differ from lecturer to tutor and it''s rather disorientating for me. Prof Khoo might mention something in his lecture but the tutors have a completely different interpretation of what they want. There’s not much guidance by our tutors as to what we should do. At some point, I felt that the comments were rather superficial – like them just going on and on about how we should market our ideas in a very specific way, but there isn’t much discussion about our analysis or the validity of our thought processes. I guess it’s a rather new module so they might be lacking a shared consensus on how the content should be like.


  
There seems to be a lack of academic rigour too. There''s quite a lot of readings and content floating around, but there''s barely any signalling as to what might be important in our learning since everything feels optional (up to use to use in our projects). As much as I would like to say that students should be responsible for their own learning – I struggle to consolidate learning points if I am given several 50 to 100-page documents each week as required readings but yet the content is barely covered in lectures. Most of my peers just ended up giving up completely on the readings. To give the module leaders some credit, I think they acknowledge this problem and might work on refining it for future batches. 
  
Most of the studied content are also recounts, narratives or “matter of fact” kinds of readings – it feels like social studies where you are told what happened, but there isn’t much critical thinking, barely providing any alternative ideas, criticisms, or analysis. I guess it might not be fair to label this as a bad thing, as I don’t think this module was meant to be an in-depth study, but more of a glimpse of how working together in a multidisciplinary urban environment will feel like.


  
Finally, I think working on group projects could be extremely difficult. I’d like to think that I’m overgeneralizing but I feel like there could be some truth in my experiences. Engineering and Design students have vastly different class schedules. I was in a group where I happened to be the only engineering student. For a module that involves a lot of communication and teamwork, it feels terrible to arrange for a common time to discuss work since it barely exists. Most of our meetings ended up just being the day before the studio at some ungodly timing. It’s almost impossible to have a meaningful discussion since in your POV: it''s 3 am the day before your studio and you’re filled with anxiety and stress to finish it even though you’ve started on the content for the past weeks by yourself.


  
(Conclusion): Although my description of the cons is much longer than the pros, I still think that this mod could be meaningful to you. Some of the drawbacks I have expressed might be something you would think of as benefits, so it might be much more enjoyable for you. Overall I think the idea behind the module is still pretty okay even though the execution might be lacking at the moment. Perhaps it will improve over time - I heard it’s a core for y’all CDE people so I hope it gets better for you. Feel free to DM me if you need have specific questions.


  
Additional tip: I think tutors play a fair amount of weighting on your individual studio performance – so try your best to look engaged or seem like you care, even though a 3-hour studio session is no damn joke and they might sometimes be v v long-winded about the points they make :)

On the other hand, if you''re more into social aspects of language and variation in language use, you''ll want to go for EL2151, which is really fun and lively. The past few years, it''s been taught by Dr. Starr too, and she''s an amazing lecturer (as you probably already know from taking EL1011E under her teaching) who can explain things crystal clear and make academia look like a piece of cake.

I''ve taken way more 3k modules than I can remember and they are all great, so I think you should go with what looks and sounds interesting to you and what you qualify for with EL1101E, which should be a decent number of them. You can join the NUS Linguistics Telegram group and read the past comments on modules and to know which modules (which lecturers) are generally avoided.","omgosh....i feel you........i struggled A LOT with the data set questions too...like initially I thought 25 questions and 60 minutes right, so I deliberately SLOWED DOWN at the start for the non-data set questions, especially cos no reverse navigation too. Only to lose out later cos I didn''t expect to take so much time for the data set questions. sigh

But I think this also stems from the lack of practice questions we had in general to practice - which Dr Leslie says is the case for this mod because he wants to discourage ''Ten Year Series'' style, which I can understand la","I agree that this mod is difficult - not in terms of the amount of workload (which is manageable IMO), but like the complexity of the content material. Frankly the 20+ slides each week are  manageble in terms of the volume of content, but i find that to  answer the PS questions and mid-term questions adequately, I have to really understand the concepts well. And that means having to read the pre-lecture readings in detail and understand the concepts involved - to me, the slides aren''t sufficient even though Dr Leslie says so. That''s my take at least...

cs2100 you need to study consistently, but if you do study consistently i think its fair. i second the fact that having a friend is useful, i floundered a bit with C and MIPS. 2101 seems to depend on if you''re a good speaker/presenter already - can pull your grade down if you''re meh/don''t try, will be incredibly easy if you''ve already had to do presentations and can pull them together fast. 2103T depends on the way your group scopes the work and who your teammates were, i found that effort and results weren''t a perfect correlate but its honestly close enough. oh and if you already have software engineering experience you''ll find it a lot easier - if you''re not sure, go open the website for 2103t and read through the projects they''ll grade you on. if you alr know what to do or how to do it you will probably find the mod easy. i suspect how difficult people found these mods are closely correlated with 1) how consistently they studied/worked(2100, 2103t to a lesser extent) 2) how good their teams were(2103t and 2101 to a lesser extent)

with that load i also took CS3241 + ST2334 + 1 mod i could pass fail that ended up being a lot of work anyway oops. messed up 2100 by not studying enough for midterms :P ST2334 is a good padding mod if you''re good at stats, but i''d also recommend not binge-learning everything 2 days before each test like I did :P i think without cs3241/my passfail mod it wld have been just nice (but also, CS3241 was fun and pretty reasonable in difficulty for me haha).

190,FIN2704X,"I took this mod last sem under Winston Low (Lecturer) and Prof Chen (Tutor). I was a Y1 FASS student if it matters. The second lecture was a recap of everything you''ve done in ACC1701X so don''t throw all that knowledge away just yet (you''ll be amazed at how everything essential in 1701X can be covered in 1 lecture). Throughout the course, you''ll be seeing some relevance in the content you learn to that of 1701X. 

Tutorials-wise, we were given a set of questions to prepare for every week. The class participation component was broken up into three components - group presentation + attendance + whether-you-can-answer-the-tutor''s-questions. Group presentations were basically just reading out your answer to the problem set to the class. The class part was a huge relief to me because I didn''t have to fight with the other biz students in my class. My tutor had a name list and he made sure to call everyone on it to ask you questions. If you couldn''t answer, he will just give you another chance after a few classes. 

The lectures are just a flurry of information thrown at you - it''s no rocket science, just ALOT of information. I''ll recommend that you read the notes and relevant chapters in the textbooks before attending the lectures. My lecturer (and soon to be yours) was great in the sense that he explained all the concepts really well and structured his slides in such a way that you can draw links between the concepts you''ve learned quite easily. Even if you don''t understand a single part, there are a thousand examples afterward that you can slowly read to break down that concept. If you''re like me and shy to ask questions during lectures, you can always just pop it in the Luminus forum (he''s super active on it).

The exams were all MCQs. Like all MCQ exams, it''s always a rush for time. The questions aren''t exactly tricky. There are a lot of computational questions, so you either get the answer or you don''t. The midterms, and finals already make up 75% of your grades, so do study for them as there is nothing else to pull up your grades (Most people will get close to full marks for the last 25%).

My general advice is to take this module with an open mind to learn and make new friends. The tutorials and lectures are together with the biz students, so there''s no separation in any sort like ACC1701X (Yes bell-curve too). There will always be those ''fin-specs'' who think they know everything and try to daunt everyone during the first few lectures/tutorials by asking super chim questions that are completely out of the syllabus.

The Finance specialisation is only open to students enrolled in a BBA or BBA (Acc) degree.

However, as to whether you can take FIN4720 or not, you might want to note that to even take FIN4720, you need to clear FIN3701 and FIN3702, which has FIN2704 as a pre req and FIN2704 has ACC1701 as a pre req. So you are looking at 24 MCs worth of UEs just to complete that whole set of modules. You might want to consider if it is worth using that many UEs or do you even have that many UEs in the first place (seeing as you are looking to do a 2nd major etc.)

Also, [iirc non biz students can only take biz modules with a ''X'' at the end of the module code](https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/kpyxv7/can_nonbiz_students_bid_for_nonx_coded_mods/) (eg FIN2704X, DAO1704X). For the rest of the modules, you might be precluded from bidding for them.

You can take modules w/o the suffix X eg MNO2705 or MKT3701. But when there is a X eg FIN2704X, you can only take those with the suffix X. All these will count towards your unrestricted electives.

my advice is take 1010s in y1s1 while you still can S/U it (just in case) and you have a free slot anyways, then overload in y1s2. you can then decide how much you want to overload in s2 by gauging from your results in s1.

>i do 28mcs in y1s2, y2s1 and y2s2

curious why you wanna rush and overload. not from RC so idk how''s the RC mods workload but 28 MCs is rlly v shag. unless you plan to fk it and S/U (which you have a limited number of in y2), even fluff mods take time and energy so you might want to keep that in mind.

respect the hustle though, and welcome to nus","I feel that if u do not intend to take a 2nd major in a tech major (DSA/bza/CS), there isn''t much point in taking cs1010s as cos1000 fulfills the same digital literacy requirement and it''s much easier from what I''ve heard (used to be cos2000). The problem with cs1010s is that the course content is condensed into 13 weeks, so it''s quite rushed and the workload is very heavy even for those with prior experience. If ure interested in learning basic programming in python, I would recommend taking MOOCs on coursera/udemy, where u can learn programming OTOT without compromising Ur other mods. But ofc if ure up for a challenge or if u alr have prior experience, the problem sets (missions) they give in cs1010s is a really good way of strengthening Ur computational thinking","U can do cs1010s in y1s1 but be prepared to adapt quickly. For me, I did 22 MCs in y1s1 with cfg1002 as my 2mc mod. And 30 MCs in y1s2 with als1010 as my 2mc mod. I cleared 2 additional core mods, with the plan to maximise the 5 S/U during the first year. 

That’s how I end up taking cs1010s in y2s1 instead.   Y2 is crucial since you can start clearing your major’s mods with only 1-2 core mod each sem. 20MCs in y2s1 due to cs1010s.

The best part is that all lectures are webcasted and there are two benefits to this:

1.	You can watch them whenever you want
2.	You don’t have to watch all of them for your graded work

Your final grade will only be based on 3 individual assignments and class participation in tutorials. No exams or group projects though there are some fun group discussion in class. There are readings but they’re very short and honestly you don’t actually *need* to read any of them.

For the graded individual assignments, you can start them as early as you want and get it over with since the lectures from the first six weeks will be available from Week 1 and the rest will be available by Recess Week.

For each of the assignments, you just need to pick a city and write 1) an image response, 2) a documentary response, and 3) a final project. They’re all pretty short and sweet but this doesn’t mean you can completely slack off because the bell curve will be pretty steep!

If you really want to put minimal effort, you can do what one of my classmates did: he watched the lectures and read the readings for Week 5 and wrote all three assignments on one of the cities from that week. He finished all three assignments by the end of recess week.

Personally, I enjoyed watching every lecture and reading every assigned reading because the content is genuinely interesting. So, if you’re a history enthusiast, this is the perfect module to learn and not worry too much about grades.

234,GEH1026,"Since u''re year 2 EE, explaining CS2030 and CS2040 workload in terms of EE mods is easier. CS2030 is somewhat similar to EE2026 workload. In 2026 u have 4 lab assignments in increasing time consumption. Total time spent on the 10 CS2030 labs is slightly higher than 4 2026 labs, but the difference is that difficulty of CS2030 labs are roughly equal (u suffer roughly equally throughout the sem), while EE2026 labs increase difficulty by 1.5-2 times every time. 

Both CS2030 (under Prof Henry) and EE2026 have projects, and both projects are released around 2nd half of semester, I would say EE2026 project is more time consuming, but this may be due to 2026 being more open-ended and I put in a lot of effort. On the other hand 2030 project is fixed with fixed test cases. I suspect that if u put average effort for EE2026 project the workload would be only slightly higher than CS2030 project. Other than that, time taken for lecture, tutorials and revising more or less similar. Only difference is that 2026 has 1 midterms but 2030 has 2 PEs (no midterms). IMO the time spent on the extra PE2 for cs2030 is balanced out by the higher project workload for EE2026.

Notice that I didn''t mention estimate time for each component becos obviously the time spent varies for diff ppl. But chances are, if u suffer and spent a lot of time debugging ur EE2026 assignments and project, likely u''ll do the same for CS2030. And if u''re the type that completes ur EE2026 assignment and project quickly, CS2030 labs and project will be quick for u too.

CS2040 lab workload is similar to CS2030. CS2040 does not have project, but more time will be spent on understanding algo concepts + practice or prepare for tests. Overall CS2040 has lower workload than CS2030 but not by a lot.

 Tutorial Journal/wiki work 10% - As long as you regularly update your tutorial journals and  provide insightful comments and personal feelings + pics and videos, should easily get the 10%

 Quizzes 20% (4 total at 5% each) - Pay attention in the lectures and take notes. Quiz has a 10 min timer iirc. Other than that I cant rmb much abt it sorry :(

Concert Reports (2 concerts) 40% (20% each) - Just need to go watch 2 concerts (external/YST concerts) and write 2 reports about your feelings and observations at the concerts. You''ll be given guidelines to follow. Not too difficult but not sure how they''re gonna get you to watch concerts now.

 Lecture Group Presentation 30% - The most important part imo. If you can ace this and reports, think you should be safe for an A.

240,GEH1050,"Hihi! I love GEH modules lol. Mostly cus my area of interest is in the arts and I usually just pick whichever module I have a strong interest in. I think NUS students tend to prioritise easy modules but they overlook how personal interest in the topic can actually make the module so much easier to score in. A mod can be fully MCQ but if I have no interest in whatever is taught, I will prolly still do badly in it. But that''s just my own personal take. I can only share my experiences based on the GEH i have taken so here is a brief review of all of them:

GEH1055 Religion and film: You get to learn about different religions around the world through movie watching which is a win win to me. You will also learn how to analyse movies and scenes on top of learning about the religion. It''s a very interesting module but its not the easiest if you are not comfortable writing film analysis.

GEH1058 The theatre experience: If you have no prior exposure to theatre, this is a great introduction to the art form! Topics and ideas are explained in very simple terms and the content is very easy to understand. As long as you are engaged and interested, i think the workload is not bad at all. And you get to watch theatre shows haha (hopefully in person cus i took this mod during covid peak)

GEH1061 Representation and media: This is a pretty basic module. Quite a relevant one too because of the rise of media usage due to the pandemic. If you enjoy pop culture and media, this will be quite enjoyable. There are some technical terms and concepts you have to understand. The TA I had for this module was so kind and sweet haha. Workload is manageable, i think the hardest part was probably the quiz but still doable i guess.

Next sem I''m going to take GEH 1060 History of Piano only because I heard that the assignments are mostly personal reflections. (which are my favourite kind of assignments cus I''m pretty good at bullshitting) And also I play a bit of piano so I thought it might be fun to learn a little about the instrument. But I still can''t vouch for it cus I''ve not taken it yet.

HAVE FUN!! :))",nope he didnt record it! he forgot to haha but he said he will record it next week onwards,yeap! think hybrid just means there are some sessions conducted in-person and the rest are conducted online,6.15,0,"36.71,11.96,9.53,23.16,18.65"
241,GEH1053,"Friend of mine took GEH1062 and while the mod is about supernatural stuff, it is more sociology related because the Prof is a sociologist by training. So its more about how supernatural stuff is linked to society etc. The workload for the mod shld be manageable - abt 1 reading per week + grp presentation (prof doesn''t focus much on your presentation skills so you can read off your script) + the exams are open-book. I do plan to take this mod as I have had good experiences taking another mod under the same Prof. You do get to watch supernatural movies but the analysis should be more about how it links to society!","It was pretty manageable! They gave us questions about the film to answer during tutorials. They''re quite simple, can be done in 15-20 minutes. The only issue is that the tutorials are kinda short, so everyone is competing for class participation.

Assignments wise there''s an essay, a mid-term and a final. For the essay, they''ll give a bunch of questions on the different films, just answer one. The questions are pretty straightforward and they give ample time to do. For the exams, they''ll let u watch a few scenes and they''ll ask questions based on the scene. It''s mostly on the film techniques. My finals were open book but I dunno if it''s the same this year haha","Hi! Taken the mod before, Dr Gilbert is one of the most profs out there, I thoroughly enjoyed the movies screened bc they aren’t your normal Netflix finds.

Due to covid most of the lectures and tutorials were done online. It was quite slack, just sharing answers to tutorial questions given beforehand. The class participation portion is quite competitive however. I found it a bit of a waste of time tbh. 

The workload was just one news report and one essay. The news report was analysing a news article and applying what whatever learnt to explain the article.

For the essay, the Prof gave 5 very broad themes and we could write anything within the theme. For example the theme I chose was relationships and dating, and I wrote about deception on online dating apps. The only complaint I have was that the essay was pretty time-consumung cus the word limit was 3.5k. The news report was 30% of the grade, and the essay was 50%. The other 20% was class participation and attendance. 

So yeah overall it was quite a slack mod haha, the content and readings are v manageable as well! I don''t know if it''s different for this semester cus the Prof changed the workload due to covid. Initially it was mid-terms and finals instead of the essay.

247,GEH1076,"Level 1000 modules can be taken by anyone, it just means they''re usually the introductory modules for many majors. For the GE (general elective) modules that you''ve listed, they''re a university requirement for all students, and students slowly clear them usually from year 1 to 3, at their own pace, depending on how they wish to schedule their academic plan. The GE modules are basically all level 1000. Being an exchange student shouldn''t affect things, but I''m not sure how big/small the cohort size is for those specific modules.  

I don''t stay on campus, but from what I hear, halls are the ones with a more vibrant play-around-with-friends life. Generally, students have to participate in hall activities to gain points to have a chance in staying the next semester. Residential colleges usually have a theme or motto that they''re based around, and it will tend to attract people with the same mindset or goals. There''s probably still fun activities going on, but I know a lot of people who just stay there and don''t participate, since they do not need to accumulate participation points to continue staying in the next semester. Either way, I think if you''re open-minded and willing to talk to people and interact with others, you will be able to make friends wherever you go.","I took GEH1049 this semester and worked my ass off to get a B+ haha. 

Can’t speak for the other module but I found this module to be quite time-consuming due to the 2x group projects and final project which required a submission of 4x essays of about 550 words each.","Hi!

Definitely enjoyable for me since Jonathan explains the concepts in a simple manner that the students can understand (also his videos are quite entertaining too). Dunno abt the bell curve.

GEI1001 is not available in AY21/22 (August 2021 -- July 2022). It will only be offered in AY22/23 (August 2022 -- July 2023). In other words, your cohort of CHS students will take it in Year 2.

See here for the availability of CHS common curriculum modules: [https://fass.nus.edu.sg/current-students/information-for-freshmen/chs-common-curriculum/](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/current-students/information-for-freshmen/chs-common-curriculum/) (Note that GEI1001 is listed as available only in Semesters 3 and 4, i.e. Year 2).

GET1050 is the previous requirement for FASS students, pre-CHS. The link you provided, in which GET1050 is mentioned, is for Cohort 2020, i.e. students who matriculated in August 2020. Although GET1050 and GEI1001 appear identical, they should be treated as different modules and you should not register for GET1050. Otherwise, you might not be able to read GEI1001 which you need, thus opening an administrative can of worms for yourself.

All the best!

Edit: to answer your question of why one module has two codes, it''s basically because it is being recoded for CHS. But some previous cohorts, who have not graduated yet, still need to complete the module with the old code.",">seems like all fass people have to take it

253,GEN2002,"Hmm I agree with you partially, but this system still seems somewhat restrictive for students who already engage in community service activities who want to get academic credit (MCs) for their activities.

Students still need to fit into the modular structure, take part in module activities, and work under the restrictions of the module. For instance, most of the modules in the OP seem to be limited to a certain agency (e.g. GEN2070 is limited to ComLink).

This is unlike the system in SMU which also gives academic credit for Community Service but seems to be much more flexible.

>Students \[in SMU\] may also consider self-proposing if they are already volunteering in their personal capacity, or have found a social cause or a volunteering opportunity that they are keen to join.

Also, I believe all these modules (at the very least, are planned to) involve a substantial practical component and are not purely/mainly theoretical in nature. The description for most of the modules mention that they will involve actual practical components, using phrases like hands-on experiences, experiential learning, and They will apply these skills.

There are sections relating to foreigners'' employment, wage, working hour, rights, and benefits that I think all international students must know in order to better protect themselves in future working.

Moreover, GES1000 is one of the few GE modules with physical classes instead of online classes - you will be attending the module in NUS Business School, making it an even more rewarding experience given how good the facilities over there are like.

Content-wise, I believe it is important that you understand the main picture of the topics as I also feel that the content can be a lot especially since the mid-terms are closed book. Mid-terms generally will test more on the bigger-picture type of questions rather than the nitty-gritty or very minor details, although there are some questions that may really just test on whether you memorise the small details, but that is the minority. Project-wise, I feel that Prof Connie wants a very original or creative response in your essay and not just common or mainstream ideas, although having common answers will not penalise you.  Finals was okay, as it was open-book but I rarely had to use the textbook as the questions were not difficult. As mentioned, try to provide your POV if possible as it shows that you have shown some thought and effort into the question. Also, maybe time management is key for the finals as I barely finished all the qns(even though I felt that I overwrote for some of the qns).You can always consult Prof Connie if you do not understand the contents; she was quite okay with consultations for my sem at least:D.

2. CA - 10% (double sided A4 cheat sheet, can prepare beforehand)
3. Final exam - 50% (MCQ, Short answer, Essay) (Closed book, no cheat sheet)

As you can see for the labs and CA, cheat sheet is allowed. So assuming that this remains unchanged this coming semester, in terms of memory work, it''s the final exam that is the most memory intensive. If you can be consistent and do decently well for the labs and CA, then it shouldn''t be too much of the problem provided that you study for the finals.

I''d say if I were u I''ll consider how spaced out my exam timetable will be like and overall workload from other modules before deciding whether to take this module.

A bit more on the labs -

Every session, which resembles more like a tutorial, will be on a different topic (e.g. rocks or map reading). For my year they''d give us an A4 colored paper at the start of each session which can be used as a cheat sheet. Everyone will take down notes during the lab on this cheat sheet.

This journal should be submitted at the end of 11th week of the semester. 

 

Term assignment- Essay (30%)

The Term Assignment should be an essay or a research paper between 1500- 2000 words to be submitted by the 10th week of the semester. Students are free to choose their own themes for the essay in prior consulation with the lecturer/ tutor.",im taking it! i applied for wed tut though.... but wld be glad to know someone else :),NULL,6.39,0,"35,20,30,0,15"

I''m a science student, so even though 10 page reading per week is supposed to be light it still took me quite some time - granted, I read them thoroughly as I was genuinely interested and I''d say knowing the readings well really helped for the midterms and finals, both essay based assessments. 

Difficulty wise, I wouldn''t say it is difficult but at times I felt lost, I think cuz of the fact that I am not used to fass mods (it''s under malay studies, but feels sociology ish to me). Like after attending lecture I''d walk away feeling that I''ve gained interesting new info, but not exactly new knowledge - thought I couldn''t structure and synthesise what I learned very well.

269,GES1011,"Hi there! I took GES1011 last sem and I''ll just briefly summarise my thoughts:

The mod''s offered by the history department and it''s being taught by Dr Kelvin Lawrence. Dr Lawrence is a great prof and he does entertains questions if you ask them. He also forces you to think by exercising one''s historical imagination - into the actual thought processes of historians. He also approaches Singapore''s history in a unique, well-organised, methodical fashion.

**Workload:** 

There are generally very few readings for tutorials but there are weekly readings for lectures. Tutorials take place on alternate weeks. One of the tutorials is a guided e-visit to Fort Canning Park and the National Museum since face-to-face tours are scrapped due to COVID-19. Another tutorial will be used for your own self-guided tour of a museum/exhibition from a given list. You''ll be asked to write feedbacks on your visit to the director of the museum/exhibition as part of your graded CA assignment.

**Participation:**

Try to engage in tutorial/lecture participation as much as possible! In fact, it''s the easiest component of your CA to score full marks in (20% of your grade).

**Exam:**

Midterms consist of a 4-hour take-home exam while finals are a 24-hour take-home exam. Both exams aren''t zoom proctored. So it''s basically your own-time-own-target.

**Verdict:**

Light workload, fun museum visits, stress-free exams, and the mod teaches you history from a fresh, critical angle while allowing you to exercise your own freedom of thought, unlike the way they''re taught in JCs and sec school. I did not have a background in history or whatsoever and I managed to clinch a decent grade from this mod! I dare say this is one of the best mods I''ve ever taken in NUS!

for both mods the readings required are q a bit. for hsa every week we''re supposed to read 1-3 papers (usually 10-15 pages) before lecture. for hsh1000, it''s 1 reading every 2 weeks, but the readings range from a short story to a whole ass 80-100 page book. but the hsh profs know it''s a lot so they''ll usually summarise it for us in lect if we can''t finish reading in time.

assessments wise, hsh is not bad in terms of the workload, quizzes every 2 weeks and group discussion summary after fortnightly tutorials. but the quizzes r rlly tricky and theyre 30% in total so fairly big stakes cos they''re like ~5,6% each. for hsa it''s p shag esp if you''re not used to writing, bc we have individual essay assignment, group project where we have to introduce/reflect on a neighbourhood in sg, and final exam where we have to write essays. it''s a lot of writing.

i definitely think it''s possible to overload though. the concepts aren''t too abstract, but hsa may be slightly boring to some if you''re not rlly interested in asian/sg history, and hsh is just overall tricky to score. and depends if u wanna S/U also haha.","I get what you''re trying to say, and it is true that there is a greater push for interdisciplinary skills in the workplace. But the way NUS is trying to do it with CHS common curriculum modules is through hastily put together fluff modules that are not meaningful and lack academic rigour.

Most students learn these interdisciplinary skills on their own (e.g. programming, digital marketing, financial modelling, graphic design, etc) because they understand that the onus is on them to develop themselves. NUS is trying to forcefully spoon feed them as though this is secondary school.

I''ve seen some of the modules shown to me by y1 freshies, and they have the makings of GEQ1000 Asking Questions written all over it.

*On the part about philosophy, you don''t need to study philosophy to think critically. No one is going to test you on epistemology or metaethics at the workplace. You also don''t need to regurgitate different normative ethical theories of value when articulating public policy. Moreover, taking fluff level-1000 modules that attempt to incorporate a shallow study of philosophy is neither necessary nor sufficient for imparting philosophical reasoning to students.*",That a lame excuse sia take mod to make u interesting.

I collaborated a bit with two friends. What we did was to do all the questions individually in the first 1hr 15 minutes (obviously that doesn''t seem like enough time to find the answers. Even 2 minutes per question is pushing it) and spend the rest of the time discussing the questions we are unsure of. Well that didn''t work out as expected, because there were too many questions and too little time. Besides, because the questions are randomised it is hard to find what questions my friends are referring to because many questions have quite similar phrasing.
At the end of it we were just pissing each other off and panicking because obviously we care more about getting our own questions solved rather than helping someone else find their answer. 
Did average for this mod in the end. I''m not sure if i would have done better if i did the finals alone, but I''m pretty sure the collaboration didn''t help.

Hope this helps!","hii i took this mod last sem (y1s1) & i really enjoyed it!! 

lecturer : prof saroja 
TA : meisen 

the module aims to teach students to view singapore’s society from a sociological perspective. i thought the lectures were v interestinf & the prof gave diff perspectives on the topics. i could be a bit biased since this mod is considered to be under ‘sociology’ & i took sc1101e too, so it was relatively easy for me to apply the concepts! 

assessment : 
tut part : 30% 
presentation : 30% 
essay : 40% (broken into 3 parts - 5% research proposal, 10% extended proposal, 25% final essay) 

im not a v outspoken person so presentations being online this sem were rly helpful since i didnt feel as pressurised or anxious + my group prepared a script beforehand so we basically js read of our scripts HAHA tbh i feel that how well you do is also dependent on the topic you get for the presentation. i got housing, family & education which was imo easier to present compared to law per se. all the topics are v interesting nonetheless! 

i rly didnt say much during tutorials which was horrible on my part but meisen does a rly good job at providing us with different perspectives of things & also knowing when to chime in while still giving us ample room to speak!! 

im used to writing essays so it wasnt too hard for me but what’s unique for this mod is that you can choose to do the essay individually - 2k words or pair up with someone & do the essay togethr - 3k words. i was lucky enough to have taken this mod w a friend so we did it tgt hahaha 

overall, i’d say that it was one of my favourite modules (then again im only a y1 student) & also the best mod gradewise. i hope this helped!! 😋",Hey i went for the lect tdy and she said that all lect will be recorded. She will prob upload soon,5.96,0,"19.8,7.6,31.6,10,31"

Content-wise, I believe it is important that you understand the main picture of the topics as I also feel that the content can be a lot especially since the mid-terms are closed book.

Project-wise, I feel that Prof Connie wants a very original or creative response in your essay and not just common or mainstream ideas, although having common answers will not penalise you.  Finals was okay, as it was open-book but I rarely had to use the textbook as the questions were not difficult. As mentioned, try to provide your POV if possible as it shows that you have shown some thought and effort into the question.

The more specific to you, the better. Write an essay (500 words, excluding references) explaining the history of the object and why it signifies home for you. Incorporate ideas from the module, as well as one or more images of the object. You will write a first draft, review several of your peers'' first drafts, then submit a final version of the paper.

Fieldtrip: In a group of 3-4 students (same tutorial – I will assign groups), visit the home of one group member and report on the object they used for the Individual Project. The group must visit together. 

Podcast: Produce a 10-15 minute (audio-only) report about your fieldtrip (20%), as well as an 800-word (excluding references) summary of the podcast (10%), explaining where you went, what you found, and how it relates to the module themes.

Also, we had to write a research paper on any of the topic covered in the lecture individually or in groups of 2-3, and it was graded by our TAs. Lastly, there were tutorials held every fortnightly, conducted by the TAs. Each TA has their own style of running their tutorial classes. For mine, the TA would send us a list of readings/videos to prepare beforehand, and she grades our tutorial participation based on attendance and how much you contribute during the class discussion.

296,GET1023,"This module is tough, not going to lie. You need the tenacity and grit to churn out 5 mini-essays in 1 hour for the midterms (6 marks for each mini-essay) and 2 hours for the finals - 6 essays (worth between 6 to 15 marks - totalling 63 marks approximately).

That being said, prior knowledge in economics is not expected but can be advantageous for only 1-2 chapters, among the 11 required. The good news is that the chapters tested are non-accumulative, implying chapters tested in the midterms are not tested in the finals. The bad news the bell curve might be a bit steeper. It trains your economic reasoning and applying economic concepts, like fundamental theorem of welfare economics, certainty and possibility effects, incentives and rationality, to the more applied topics like economic reasoning in crime, happiness, inequality across/within countries.

Since the midterms account for 30% and finals 35% , the rest comes from your class partcipation in your tutorials and lectures (which are conducted through zoom for the previous sem). A 15% component is allocated to MCQs, which answers can be found in your readings.

Readings are plentiful, but it is not over-exaggerated like 80 pages per week. (I gauge 20 to 30 pages but a good way to trick yourself to read all readings is to print 8 pages of readings onto a double-sided paper) Annonate and contribute actively to tutorials.

To score, time management is essential. I prepare by having lectures notes condensed/made it more succinct by paraphrasing or adding my own line of arguments, tutorial answers and an example sheet (mostly used in the midterms), all in physical form (for me). Most of the questions are relatively average and it it essential to give your main points to score. Always ANSWER all parts of the questions.

Bell-curve is hard to beat for most GE modules, that being said, you would definitely have a blast from learning and reading. The last advice for you is to type fast (touch-typing) since you will need the time to process the questions and organise your arguments/examples to fit the questions.

This is my 3rd GET option - the first being advertising and the 2nd related to economics. So it isn''t a very popular module, however, if you have a knack of reading interesting stories and sound reasoning, you are assured to do well. All the best in your module selection!","Hi! I took this module last semester. I was overloading but I felt this module was a good break from my core modules. 

I previously took H1 Economics in JC and EC1301 but I honestly don’t think it gave me any advantage. It’s more “how an economist thinks” instead of “economics concepts”. 

The first half of the module has less intensive and more intuitive concepts. The second half has more hard-to-understand concepts, but it is still very manageable.

Exams are open-ended questions (5 for mid-term, 6 for finals if I recall correctly) but it doesn’t really require a long answer as long as you hit the points he is looking for, I would think. The suggested answers provided by him are pretty short and succinct. The best part of this module is that the first and second half are tested separately (hooray! 6 weeks of content each). 

Class participation is graded so you have to prepare beforehand (that means reading the readings before the tutorial and preparing an outline of answers).

There are weekly quizzes (answers found in readings) and lecture participation (PollEverywhere questions slotted throughout the lecture, but your answer does not matter). 

Honestly, he doesn’t cover much in his lectures, so the whole module really comes down to how committed you are to reading the readings. I split the workload with a friend of mine to summarise the readings so I think taking this module with a friend or friends is insanely helpful. For exams, he tests minor details so it’s not enough to summarise key points (for example, this year, he tested “Angela Merkel implemented a policy in year XXXX” (search in reddit and you’d know this question stumped a lot of people), so after mid-terms, I knew to summarise almost everything so it is possible to CTRL-F (most readings are scanned so you must type everything out) and also pick out the main points for revision.

I feel that as long as you do your work consistently (pay attention during tutorials, whether or not you prepared, to catch up with the content; skim through readings at least before tutorials; do an overall summary of all readings before each exam) you should be able to attain a good grade. I skipped revision of one chapter for the finals as I procrastinated my readings... but still managed to get an A miraculously. I honestly don’t think the bell curve is steep (from the tutorial, seems like most people don’t even read the readings lol) so just give it a shot! 

P.S. There are notes available on Carousell but he updates the content from semester to semester so most of them are outdated.

Hope this helps. :)","I concur with the point of splitting the workload. It really helps if you have a good friend helping you to consolidate the readings. Yeah, it''s more of economic reasoning and thinking than economic concepts, so do focus more of the reasoning. (Understanding the reasoning is very important, and you can ask the prof/ stay back and listen to others after lecture/tutorial sessions).

\*I view economic terms like certainty/possibility effects, fundamental theorem of welfare economics as economic concepts, but I think economic reasoning is a more nuanced description.

For tutorials, since there are quite a few tutorial slots, the learning experience may differ. I find mine very competitive so it generally helps when you participate. Also agree with the fellow redditor to write some key-points for tutorials and during the tutorials. Tutorials and lectures are conducted by the prof himself. There may be a TA for some logistical stuff, but he/she rarely appears.

I think it''s also okay to skip 1 or 2 lectures since they are web-casted. I personally skipped one and emailed to prof the reason who is quite understanding. (Can''t say the same for tutorials, but I think he''s fine either way if you provide a valid reason).

There was a **group project which was 20%** (we had to come up with our own disney story based on current situations in the world). Then there was a **group presentation and QA on the project worth about 10%**. **Forums and class participation during lecture and tutorials constituted about 15%**. Until here is the fun part haha.

The remaining 55% were mostly essay based. We had to write a **10% reflection (take home assignment)** on our first tutorial discussion (500 words iirc). There was a **midterm test (15%)** which was hybrid, there were mcqs, fill in the blanks and 2 essay qns (relatively short ones). Finally there was a **30% final test (we were given about 2 days to complete and submit it)** which is just essay qns, I think got like 2 or 3 qns.

Do read all your required readings before class.

And do try to contribute to discussions during the Group Readiness Assessment & the application exercises.

With that said, please try to contribute for the Written Proposal and the Poster Presentation. My group had someone who kinda contributed v little to it and often MIA-ed so it was really tough chionging the deliverables esp since the submissions are towards the end of the sem. Which is where you''ll be damn busy with other mods. I had a fun time, and my fav classes were the ones on Neuroscience & Emerging Infectious Diseases.

It''s ultimately a CS/CU mod, and I overloaded when I took this mod (tho I overloaded with GEQ1000). The workload is actually quite okay, but some might feel its quite heavy coz of the written proposal (many drafts depending on how onz your group is). 

Really had a great time taking this module! Having in-person classes, discussing the quizzes with my grpmates & doing the group proposal tgt - it was really fun!!!

The Finance specialisation is only open to students enrolled in a BBA or BBA (Acc) degree.

However, as to whether you can take FIN4720 or not, you might want to note that to even take FIN4720, you need to clear FIN3701 and FIN3702, which has FIN2704 as a pre req and FIN2704 has ACC1701 as a pre req. So you are looking at 24 MCs worth of UEs just to complete that whole set of modules. You might want to consider if it is worth using that many UEs or do you even have that many UEs in the first place (seeing as you are looking to do a 2nd major etc.)

Also, [iirc non biz students can only take biz modules with a ''X'' at the end of the module code](https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/kpyxv7/can_nonbiz_students_bid_for_nonx_coded_mods/) (eg FIN2704X, DAO1704X). For the rest of the modules, you might be precluded from bidding for them. You might want to drop the faculty an email to check whether non biz students can actually bid for FIN4720, since it does not have a ''X'' in the module code.","Am doing a second major in business management and I’m from CNM. You can take modules w/o the suffix X eg MNO2705 or MKT3701. But when there is a X eg FIN2704X, you can only take those with the suffix X. All these will count towards your unrestricted electives. 

During your study at NUS, you can create your own double degree but you usually need to fulfil some prerequisites first - eg fulfil X number of MCs.

Midterms cover the 4 assignments and the above financial topic, and generally the mean is pretty high too. Overall, just need to memorise a few math equations but to utilise them properly.

1.	You can watch them whenever you want
2.	You don’t have to watch all of them for your graded work

Your final grade will only be based on 3 individual assignments and class participation in tutorials. No exams or group projects though there are some fun group discussion in class. There are readings but they’re very short and honestly you don’t actually *need* to read any of them.

For the graded individual assignments, you can start them as early as you want and get it over with since the lectures from the first six weeks will be available from Week 1 and the rest will be available by Recess Week.

For each of the assignments, you just need to pick a city and write 1) an image response, 2) a documentary response, and 3) a final project. They’re all pretty short and sweet but this doesn’t mean you can completely slack off because the bell curve will be pretty steep!

If you really want to put minimal effort, you can do what one of my classmates did: he watched the lectures and read the readings for Week 5 and wrote all three assignments on one of the cities from that week. He finished all three assignments by the end of recess week.

Personally, I enjoyed watching every lecture and reading every assigned reading because the content is genuinely interesting. So, if you’re a history enthusiast, this is the perfect module to learn and not worry too much about grades.

The professor is also super funny and really sweet. She makes learning about history engaging through personal anecdotes and storytelling. Be sure to chat with her beyond coursework if you’re actually interested in the history of cities!

Hope this helps and safe travels to Singapore!","Luck module (GEC1028) was a fun mod, prof GG is a great teacher that had to make do with the lack of response in zoom lectures, overall content is interesting and makes u think abt the role of luck in life

Readings are average for a GE/arts mod, exams are based on core concepts found in the readings 

Not particularly difficult unless one is trying for A, which requires a deeper understanding of how the concepts were applied and which are used in which context

Would recommend regardless as a GE/UE","AY2020/21 Sem 1 : IS4228

I thoroughly enjoyed all the lessons (although it would have been more fun with physical classes), but it is still ultimately a language class with reference to business and social science. 

The prof is pretty helpful by offering consultations (and open to accepting them) and is always encouraging students to speak up to share our thoughts about certain news article, etc. We also build our language skills by reading news article verbally.

These are the main components:
1)  Radio Reporting (Shortening 3 news article to 150 words each) - 15%
2) Mini-Presentation on Pros and Cons of a Speaker/Presenter - 20%
3) Reflection Essay of 800 words on the story “Who Stole my Cheese” - 20%
4) Group Project - presenting on a businessman ideology and your evaluation of him/her - 25%
5) Final Test (2 essay within 4 hours) - 20%

Hope this helps! If you have any further question, feel free to let me know!","Hello! It depends on your current language skills, and how fast you are able to pick up new words/phrases. However, I would say that additional hours for review and self-study are largely optional, as we are not directly tested on the words/phrases learnt. It’s one of the more chill modules, and even in group projects, the lecturer will try to ensure each group will have at least one teammate who have stronger Chinese ability as well.

I usually spend an additional an hour or two (sometimes lesser) to pre-read the articles that we need to share our thoughts with in class, but that’s pretty much it. All in all, if I’ve no graded submissions, I usually spend a maximum of 2 hours a week and if there is, sometimes more, depending on the rigour of each assignment. For example, I spent 3 hours on the mini-presentation and 12-14 hours on the 800 words essay.","I took CL2280 and 2281. I would have loved to move on to the Advanced Translation one or even complete a Minor in Translation; alas, I only found out about the Minor in Year 3 and it was far too late for me to make changes to my acad planning :(

I enjoyed my classes under Dr Ho Chee Lick - it can get a bit technical but it''s manageable if you practise, and I found that there''re always opportunities to practise (just look at noticeboards/town council announcements; half the time the translation is shitty). My only problem with Dr Ho is that he''s very 随性 as an artist so a lot of things he will 睁一只眼闭一只眼. For example, there was rampant cheating among Mainland Chinese students in both 2280 and 2281 but he never took action against them; nice of him as a person, but somewhat disadvantageous to students lah.

I hear from juniors however that in recent semesters Dr Ho is no longer teaching the modules, and there seems to be somewhat negative feedback against more recent lecturers.",6.06,0,"17.45,6.54,21.48,26.85,27.68"
355,LAC4202,"hi! i was an exchange student who took an LAC mod for one semester at NUS. technically, the workload is very light, as the assignments are limited to: 

1. a few pages of workbook problems, due weekly (very easy, take like 20 min to complete. seriously) 

2. oral assignments scattered here and there (simply record yourself reading an assigned passage from
the textbook) 

3. a group project where you interview a native speaker (super easy and engaging, done in a fairly large group so the work is spread very thinly. for mine i literally only had to write 2 questions and then attend the interview) 

however, the work assigned will not teach you the language, nor will it guarantee your grade on the quizzes and exams. most of the students in my class would spend 0 time studying the language on their own and would only put effort towards the assignments, resulting in failing grades on the quizzes (our professor was literally shocked with the quiz grades and said it was the worst she’d seen in a long time). so basically, my point is that even though the workload is light, it is still incredibly time consuming to learn a language. especially if it is a language that you want to continue with to an advanced level. the course itself may not be that demanding in terms of assignments, but it will require hours and hours to keep up with the content every week and commit it all to memory. every week we had to memorize about 20-30 characters,  and on top of that there were grammar rules and concepts. and that was for the very first semester for absolute beginners. keep in mind that the content is (obviously) cumulative, so you need to make time for review as well as for the new content. 

the lecture is super valuable and engaging (4 hrs per week) and there’s lots of helpful practice provided so i really recommend participation. i would also recommend reviewing the content for the lecture before you attend. 

I would say I committed at least 30min daily to studying the language for a minimum of 4 hours per week, and I got 100% on every quiz and exam. Maybe that was overkill, but I personally wanted to learn the language rather than just obtain the credit for the course. 

so yeah, really it’s up to you how much effort you put into the course/ learning the language. you can probably get away with a lot less studying than I did, especially if your goal is just to pass and obtain credit. but basically, even though the assigned workload is ridiculously light, i think that the course is quite a commitment if you want to do well and retain the knowledge.","I’m a CS student, took the mod in y2s1 where I also took 4 other mods. 

The workload for LAC was definitely much much lighter as compared to the other mods that I was taking. Classes are 2 hours, twice per week. Have graded homework submission at the end of each chapter. They normally take 2 weeks to complete a chapter. There’s also a group project component where we need to interview a native speaker, it’s quite light and manageable. 

There were also quizzes and exams. They were quite low stake and I think median was around 60%. The assessments were all just what was taught in class, so if you study properly actually it’s not that hard to get around 80% and above.

As for the demographic of the students, I think most people have some background but not a lot. You can definitely do decently with some effort. 

Just to give a rough gauge, I had some basic background but not a lot. Spent roughly 1-2 hours weekly on the mod. Scored quite decently, so it’s quite manageable :)","Yes, I took 3201 and I plan to stop at 3202. Workload for 3201 is similar to lower level. But the difficulty is much higher imo.

All the content were mostly delivered in chinese and roughly around 40% of the students can somewhat communicate in chinese already. Not sure if it’s just my class but there were lots of exchange students who already uses chinese at home. So yeah that’s the demographic.

366,LAK3202,"Took both modules in AY20/21, module coordinator was Ms Cho Jin Hee.

**Disclaimer:** As Ms Cho is no longer the module coordinator for these modules, and according to LumiNUS, the coordinators for LAK3201 and LAK3202 are different for AY21/22, not all of what I talk about below will be applicable to you, so you can just take it as a reference but it won''t be definitive of your experience.

For example, from what I see on LumiNUS, you will have an oral test and weekly reflection note submissions next semester. We didn''t have these last year; our oral component was just a video assignment, similar to in LAK3201.

In my experience, LAK3202 was more manageable in terms of workload than LAK3201. Several factors:

(a) No quiz in Weeks 4 and 10 for LAK3202

(b) For LAK3201, we had a writing/essay exam in the same week as the final LumiNUS quiz exam. This was originally going to be the same for LAK3202 (which you might see on LumiNUS), but Ms Cho removed this for LAK3202 after student feedback.

(c) We also had weekly typing practice for the first half of LAK3201 (where we just type out a short passage and submit, just for practice). Even though this wasn''t graded and technically you could just copy-paste, it was just another component of the workload that added up with the other stuff.

As for the content, I think there isn''t a huge jump from LAK3201 to LAK3202. Obviously it will be more challenging and needs effort to understand and familiarise but I think it''s just natural progression so I didn''t find it too bad. One additional thing in LAK3202 was that for each e-Lecture, we learned a figure of speech/expression. So this one just involves a bit more memory work/practice. But idk if you will have this next sem as well.

About the weekly reflection note, I assume that it will be in a similar format as what we do in LAK4201. If so, here''s my input on that.

For LAK4201 weekly reflection notes, we just have to journal our learning process and thoughts on our learning experience in the past week. The aim is to get us to be more conscious of our learning experience and also gain practice writing in Korean. Dr. Park emphasised that she won''t grade based on Korean accuracy; it''s purely based on submission.

My thoughts: It does add to the weekly workload and at times I felt quite sian to have to think of what to write at the end of the week. But this isn''t a very heavy component, just honestly write what you think and can finish within 1 hour or even 30 mins (depending on typing speed I guess).

But yeah this one is just my experience, not sure if yours will be the same next semester. If anything you can always email the module coordinator to clarify some of the assessment components.

Personally, I would say that you should just go for it, if your other module choices are manageable as well. If you enjoyed LAK3201, I think you will enjoy LAK3202 too.

Also, (if your flair is accurate and you''re in Year 1), just use your S/Us if necessary lor. Language modules can S/U so don''t stress too much haha. Another thing to note is that you might get modrekt cos of seniority level, so you might not get your first choice lecture slot. (But then again it seems you''ll have 5 lecture slots as opposed to 4 that we had last year, so not so bad.)

373,LAT1201,"Hi, I’m a biz Yr4 student. Took Thai 1,2,3 with corresponding grades A,A,A+. Initially got asked by a friend to take this mod tgt so we did but he grad after thai 2 alr.

Like all lang mods, in first mod, there will be people with some knowledge of the language alr. But for Thai, unlike other mods like Japanese (took Jap1-3 too), almost everyone has zero  to little knowledge so not to worry. Some people can speak a little Thai, but after week 6-7, everyone should be on equal standing alr 

There are 6 HW sets to be submitted every fortnight, you have like 5 days to complete once released. Very basic for level 1, just sentence construction and writing thai scripts (if you don’t know just refer to the book lol). I would say the grammar taught is very easy, the only tricky parts are the listening quizzes, it may be hard to catch cos they speak rather quickly and we lack exposure.

Oral tests, writing tests are generally okay, not too difficult and that usually give you mock tests beforehand so make sure you do that to prep. Content wise 1 chapter every week but there again, it’s all in phonetic script so quite easy tbh.

The only challenging part for Thai is when it hits level 3, that’s when you start learning very difficult vocabulary and they don’t really strictly follow the textbook anymore. 

The key is consistency, every component counts: your HW, listening, oral, writing, participation,cultural project. Do it seriously! For writing quizzes, make sure you do well (they have the largest component of the grade esp writing test 2). For oral, try to pick a good partner you have chemistry with haha (you would know since you will practice with many peeps in class). If you pick someone who wanna SU this mod then gg alr.

For Thai 1, to secure your A, try to get at least 85% for all your components. Anyways at least for my time, many people I know wanna just take this mod for exposure and intend to SU so curve isn’t too steep. Only for Thai 2-3, the bell curve applies cos cohort is quite small. For that reason at least 1/3 of class should secure A- and above.","Different textbooks have different phonetic ways to interpreting thai script so if you know how to write thai script it’ll be the best if you are doing Thai in the long term. Unfortunately, you still have to abide by NUS’s way of writing phonetic script (yes you’ll be penalised for mistakes) at lower level modules.


You will continue using phonetic script till thai 2 based on the textbook (although Teachers discourage still using phonetic script at Thai 2). Only the last writing quiz for Thai 2 (including closed book compre and composition) would you be required to write in thai scripts. Thai 3 onwards all Thai scripts alr, so in some sense the faster you ditch phonetic script the better off you’ll be.

Anyways, even at Thai 3 level, at least for me, it’s a pain to read thai scripts so when I craft my show and tell, oral presentation scripts, I usually do it with phonetic so I can read and practice my scripts more quickly!",NULL,6.4,0,"9.5,2.5,6.5,33,48.5"

&#x200B;

For me, they are like these:

Molecular Genetics: workload is light but the content might be a bit difficult since it involves many molecular stuffs and also math (especially for the third section). Not much reading except you will get some papers to learn before CA.

Evolutionary Biology: probably with the highest workload due to the weekly reading and quizzes. You need to at least read one chapter from a textbook provided each week. If you are someone who is interested in learning evolutionary concepts, these may sound easy for you otherwise you can spend a longer time digesting the concepts especially since the concepts discussed are interconnected. IMO this is probably the best module out of the core 2Ks. 

Molecular Cell Biology: cover stuffs that might be already learned during JC/HS. Workload and content-wise, IMO, it is the lightest and the easiest among the three. Not much reading except lecture slides.","Hey, i''m taking the HSI, HSS and DTK side. From what I''ve heard from ppl doing HSA and HSH side, they sound a lot more time consuming than HSS, HSI and DTK. However, DTK assignments can be q time consuming, and HSS have some required readings, which if u decide to read may take a while. HSI1000 is q easy imo as there''s only pre-recorded lecture videos, no tutorials, only workshops that u have to attend 3 times in the semester and a 4 hour lab that you have to once during the semester, but there''s 3 block tests that make up around 50% of the grade if i''m not wrong, so it''s up to u if u wanna study hard for those.","Hello, I''m taking HSS HSI DTK. HSI & HSS workload are fine with weekly quizzes and the once a month assignment for HSI workshops + 1 lab Sessions. (I havent attend yet). HSI lectures are pre-recorded while HSS is live but they also got upload recording afterwards. 

The one I want to warn you is DTK. Workload is very hands on and submissions are every 2 weeks which seem quite okay at the start but gets more and more heavy as you progress.

ES1000 - no idea

GEQ1000 - basically a 0.5MC class

GER1000 - see above

ST2334 - if you like probability and combinatorics, this class should be easy for you. Very study-able by chionging PYP if you''re not good at it.

CS2106 - an infamous class (because it''s a graduation requirement) known for its difficulty. I found it manageable (and fun sometimes, especially the last 2 topics on Memory and Filesystems), but the labs can take quite awhile if you''re struggling and if you don''t have friends taking it with you

CS2101 - your typical English class which has presentations and essays sprinkled throughout, and is annoyingly 2x 2hrs per week like all English classes it seems. If you can smoke through presentations or find them easy, it''s an easy class. Otherwise, prepare to suffer.

CS2103T - the workload is as high as you want it to be. If you''re the type where a project is never done til the deadline passes and you''re aiming for A/A+, expect a very high workload in the number of hours you spend on the project. Otherwise, I''m pretty sure you can just chiong it in a week or so. I did the former and got pretty much full marks for the project, but still got a B+ because of the finals, so don''t neglect your theory.

ES1103 - no idea

CS3243 - never took it. a few friends said it was tough and pretty useless though

LSM1303 - no idea, I took a physics class I enjoyed for my science requirement","Just in case it wasn’t a typo, intro to ai is cs3243 rather than cs3234 (a logic module).

Also, cs2101, even tho is cs-coded, is a communication module that can be s/u-ed. If you’re 
planning to s/u it along with some of your other non-cs mods, it will definitely be a very manageable sem.

Otherwise, you might have to invest quite some time in both cs2101 and lsm1303 to get a relatively decent grade, since both have a rather huge group work component.

381,LSM2191,"For me it was a fun experience. You are basically grouped into small groups of 4 and a TA mentors several small groups. You’ll do basic experiments like cloning and protein purification over the course of a semester and you’ll need to write up 2 reports, one due mid sem and one at the end of sem. There is a mid term ÇA and final too, and like most other mods, the content and format of the assessment will depend on the module coordinator. However, the experiments during the practical have been constant over the past 2 years (i took it 5 sems ago and a friend who took it recently verified that they’re still doing the same practicals) so you can ask your seniors for practicals to pre read beforehand. I enjoyed the lab practicals and learning abt the experiments. this mod gave me an indication that research might be something that I would enjoy and hence I went on to take more research projects after this mod. 

Other comments I’ve generally heard were that the practical sessions were long and the reports are taxing (which reports aren’t tho). Some of my friends also realised through this mod that experimental techniques and working at the lab bench wasn’t for them and they steered away from research heavy stuff later on too. Generally I feel LSM2191 being a compulsory mod for all life sci ppl is important because research is fundamental to all scientific discovery and life sci is no exception.

I would say that LSM2252 is considerably lighter than LSM2251 in terms of CAs. There were two essay assignments and one practical exam (where you look at specimens and identify them or characteristics about them), and three field trips. The bulk of the work for LSM2252 lies in content: there''s a huge survey of the animal phyla and a less-huge-but-still-kinda-huge survey of plants. You have to be very familiar with the content and it comes at you like a bullet train.

383,LSM2233,"I took it last sem under prof thilo as well, and echo whatever the other user mentioned! Prof thilo is easily one of the best profs ive had the privilege to be taught under so far, so I''ll definitely recommend you to take in sem 2 if timetabling allows.

Some tips if you''re gonna take it under prof thilo:

- attend all his lectures! there will be a team quiz at the end of most of his lectures, some are graded, some have participation marks

- just ask questions, don''t hesitate to email him. He''s a rly friendly prof so no need to be wary or anything

- put effort into the team video assignment, that''s free marks

- make sure you watch the pre-lecture videos he uploads before each lecture, otherwise you''ll be pretty lost

- transcribe, transcribe, transcribe. His lecture notes are pretty scarce, like those only got pictures kind haha. And he can spend like 20+ mins explaining a diagram on a single slide. But the good thing is he speaks at a rather manageable pace so you shouldn''t have a problem with that, lectures are recorded anyway

- no need to dead memorize everything. CA is based solely on interpreting the figures of a research paper provided, and this makes up the bulk of finals question type too

- that said it would still help to make a concept map kinda thing at the end of each major topic. At some point, you will find that most of the concepts taught across the different topics are actually interlinked together, this will help tons in your revision

- if your finals grade > your CA grade, prof thilo will pull up your CA grade to match your finals since he views it as a sort of improvement haha. So don''t need to be too discouraged if you don''t do well in CA. Hopefully he continues this practice next year haha

If you have any cell bio questions at any time during the sem feel free to reach out (even tho I highly recommend you consult prof thilo first), I may be able to help!","Took this mod in 20/21 Sem 2 under Prof Thilo Hagen. 

Im not sure about the other lecturer (Yeong Foong May) but if your lecturer is Prof Thilo, his style is nothing compared to other lecturers, who just throw all the content at you and ask you to memories everything. Because of his emphasis on “acquiring cell biology skills” instead of memorising content per se, his lecture notes were mostly pics with little to no words and content was delivered through live lectures and during/after doing the Learning Catalytic (LC) quizzes during lectures. There will be some content in the lecture notes but don’t expect it to be like your other mods’. For exams, there was rly nothing much to memorise because qns were application-based and open book. Both CA and finals qns were from research papers which were given to us about two weeks before the exams and all the content that he taught us during lectures prepared us adequately to interprete and understand the research papers. 

Tbh, when I first took this mod, I was confused on how to study given his very different teaching style. Moreover, his lectures were quite messy at times. However, after some time, I realised that I did not study this module the way it supposed to be, which is “dont memorise, just read, interpret, and understand” because this mod teaches you a lot of life science skills. 

Lectures were very engaging as we did individual and team LC quizzes, he would asked us qns while he went through content. Basically nothing like your typical lecture. He would rly try to get to know us because he’s rly a nice prof. We also had a team assignment, whereby we had to make a 5-7 mins video about our research findings that pertain to cell biology (Eg My grp did on Branched chain amino acid and its molecular pros and cons). 

If you prefer this kind, take this mod on the sem that Prof Thilo Hagen will be lecturing. He’s a rly superb and passionate lecturer.","I took 2241 last year, easily one of the better modules I have taken in NUS. Very useful for 2191 and other mods with lab reports.

I get a lot of students who come back to me after taking LSM2241 and tell me how it helped them in their UROPS or FYP. 

One of the most dramatic developments in Life Sciences in the last decade or so has been the availability of whole genomes, not just for humans but for many other organisms. When people do genomics, they are often stuck in the bioinformatics analysis. So the module is mostly focused on DNA and protein sequences.

In LSM2241 I don''t require any coding: most of the work is done via websites and applications with graphical interfaces. I do teach some algorithms, though, so students know what''s happening behind the scenes. A good comparison is between LSM2241 and LSM2191. Both modules cover the Blast algorithm to search for sequences similar to a query sequence. In LSM2191, however, students don''t learn much about how the algorithm works, which is really helpful for choosing the right parameters and interpreting the results. IMO, it''s also helpful in general.","Yes, that''s right. Unlike some practice track faculty, I have a conventional academic training (PhD in Biophysics and Biochemistry from Yale, postdoc at Harvard). But I went into biotech and pharma after my postdoc.

Later on the site expanded to about 150 people with three equal-sized units: one early drug discovery, one translational biomarker work, and one IT unit. I continued to lead the systems biology/biomarker unit, and was CTO (Chief Technology Officer) for the site. 

After a re-organisation in Eli Lilly the Singapore research site was closed down and I had to decide between staying with Lilly but moving back to the US, finding a position at another company, or staying in Singapore. My family was settled in Singapore; I was already an adjunct faculty member at NUS, and had taught a few lectures every year, so when the opportunity came I took it. I really like the research that we are doing, and I enjoy teaching.

Cognitive psych is an eh.... module. Took it under prof nic hon and it was just voice recordings embedded in ppt slides so its good in the sense that its really OTOT, but he doesn''t go through everything you need to know and WILL test things from the textbook so you need to be prepared to do your readings as well. In my opinion, I think developmental psych is rather content heavy, I took it under prof nina, she''s very articulate and knowledgeable but she speaks at the speed of light and does not record her lectures so it gets really hard to grasp the content sometimes.

For sanity purposes, I would personally recommend taking only 2 of them at once, especially since you have plans to overload.

386,LSM2252,"OOOOF. Y3 Psych major here! Dang... I mean it''s definitely not impossible. Content wise, I think social psychology is the easiest to grasp so you don''t need to worry /too/ much. Cognitive psych is an eh.... module. Took it under prof nic hon and it was just voice recordings embedded in ppt slides so its good in the sense that its really OTOT, but he doesn''t go through everything you need to know and WILL test things from the textbook so you need to be prepared to do your readings as well. In my opinion, I think developmental psych is rather content heavy, I took it under prof nina, she''s very articulate and knowledgeable but she speaks at the speed of light and does not record her lectures so it gets really hard to grasp the content sometimes. As she tries to encourage critical thinking, there is no hard memorisation that you need to do, but her application questions are Really challenging.

For sanity purposes, I would personally recommend taking only 2 of them at once, especially since you have plans to overload. I don''t believe that LSM is a walk in the park so you need to take that into consideration! That said, if you can manage your time well and can function well under stress, go ahead :)

Bio psych had biweekly quizzes, and pre-lecture videos for at least half the sem on top of the regular lecture so .... it was really yikes for me (just took it this sem). PL2132 is a project-based module which means the workload is constant, whereas cognitive psych is just midterms and finals so it depends on what you define as manageable HAHAHA. The content from PL2132 isn''t the easiest, especially when it gets to three-way ANOVA (you will understand this comment when you take the module) but since you like stats, I think it''ll be a good break from the amount of content dealt from social and dev psych!   


That said, I understand the concerns you have and I think that... Yeah. Maybe don''t take PL2132 yet. HAHAHA.

408,MA2116,"This one is a unique case but I think its more helpful to think of the preclusion as one-way instead of going both ways. That is, the Econs department is okay if you take ST2334 and ST3131 (R) in place of EC2303 and EC3303 (stata). Reason is because EC3303 uses stata which is only useful for econometric analysis. If you go and apply for internships you''ll see that employers want students with proficiency in either R or python. The Econs department recognises that, and given the rigour of ST2234 and ST3131 provided by the Math department, are okay with students doing that instead. So instead of the usual EC2303 --> EC3303 --> EC3304 route, you can take ST2334 --> ST3131 --> EC3304.

On the other hand, my guess is that the math department wants you to take ST2234 for the minor in mathematical finance because you will re-visit some of that knowledge in ST3131. So you might die trying to jump from EC2303 to ST3131. That, or they may feel that the rigour in EC2303 provided by the Econs department does not match up to ST2234.","Foremost this is Abit off topic and secondly, I want to apologise if I sound offputing / rude. 

I think is just that math in JC / highschool is very calculus centric so we tend to feel like real analysis is the be-all-end-all of mathematics. So the cliche saying you can''t say you studied maths if you haven''t encountered xxx is like such a lame reason to justify to study something. I can also say the same for almost every topic 😂😂

Okay secondly, saying that all other maths is accessible because you learned some real analysis is very misleading. Maybe you meant to say that one would have more practice at trying to learn new definitions so you wouldn''t have an absolutely terrible time, but sometimes, you still do have an absolutely dogshit time if you don''t know what the objective of the topic is, or the textbook is written in a overly rigorous manner / written full of gaps for yourself to fill in. 

Finally, is good that you are able to pick up topology easily. But I suspect that the reason you''re able to do so is because you studied some real analysis, and topology is just an abstraction of concepts you may have otherwise encountered in analysis (open set vs epsilon delta continuity, compactness vs Heine borel) and so you have a concrete model of otherwise very abstract concepts in topology.","Ok to elaborate why I think studying real analysis well makes other branches more accessible is because if we understand the topics well, it means that you have reached a certain level of mathematical maturity. For example, understanding epsilon delta proofs would indicate some form of mathematical maturity, since it''s likely most math encountered till that point does not require such thinking.

 There are of course many ways to reach this, but for a beginner, I feel real analysis is a promising starting point as it bridges the gap between calculus and the mindset needed to approach more abstract problems. At the very least, the terms seen in real analysis should be somewhat familiar compared to say algebra 


Of course, I agree with you that a good textbook or instructor is needed, or else you won''t really know what''s going on or what''s the point of learning this. For example, when I took LA 2 back then, I really had no idea why I''m learning the things I learnt, or what''s the end goal of learning and proving those (at that point in time) seemingly random lemmas and theorems. A good textbook (and ideally, teacher) is needed to point you to the right stuff to focus on.

You can do other Data Literacy modules (eg DSA1101, ST1131, etc.) instead. In fact, other Data Literacy mods are probably more in depth than GEA1000, so they might be a better choice if u want to pursue this minor I guess

>However, DSA3361 requires these four mods as prerequisites; GEA1000, MA2401 (which I will already be required to take within the minor) as well as MA2002 and ST2131. However, the module MA2401''s preclusions include the module MA2002 which means if I take MA2002 first (which I intended to), I won''t be able to take MA2401. 

I believe you are reading the NUSMods prereq tree. As stated on NUSMods:

> The prerequisite tree is displayed for visualization purposes and may not be accurate. Viewers are encouraged to double check details.

If you read the prerequisites for the module, the prerequisites are: (I''ve added paragraphing for clarity) 

> {GEA1000 Quantitative Reasoning with Data or GER1000 Quantitative Reasoning or DSA1101 Introduction to Data Science or DSE1101 Introductory Data Science for Economics or ST1131 Introduction to Statistics and Statistical Computing} and 
>
>MA2401 Introductory Mathematics with R 
>
>MA2401 may be replaced by three modules as follows:
>
> - One module from MA1101R, MA1311, MA1508E, MA1513, or MA2001; and 
>
>- One module from MA1102R, MA1312, MA1505, MA1507, MA1511, MA1521, or MA2002; and
>
> - One module from MA2216/MA2116/ST2131 or ST2334

As such, you can fulfil prereqs with just GEA1000 and MA2401.

Wrt DSA3362, it is actually on NUSMods here: https://nusmods.com/modules/DSA3362/predictive-data-analytics

Two, you can consult your school to see if you can take an LOA next semester and resume in Sem 3, so that you don''t have to pay extra school fees.

MNO3703 is a deeper delving into leadership styles. Every prof teaches this mod differently so I can’t say for sure, but what my prof did was to use case studies to explore the leadership styles the class voted on at the start of the semester. We then balloted for our group presentations at the end. 

MNO3702 is based on negotiation cases, so you will play different scenarios in class each week to apply the different concepts such as reservation points and stuff. You therefore have a chance to find and hone your own negotiation style, and be exposed to other unique approaches.

Prepared in detail with focus on every minute feature, it has a plethora of tools for engaging, hiring and nurturing employees.

With the HR bot phia, peopleHum is made 10x better since it lets HR professionals delegate routine tasks to the bot. The ''Huddle'' feature launched recently also allows for better connectivity and collaboration in remote work settings. You can also customize your own feedback templates, recognize someone for their contribution on peopleHum. With constant updates, it is one of the best softwares with state of the art tools.

1) your own affinity with the content
2) the prof taking your class
3) how much effort you decide to put in

To put it briefly: 
3701 is about the different HR processes such as recruitment, training, compensation etc

3702 is more specifically about negotiation and how you can better do so in various contexts

3703 is more specifically about leadership and management styles

423,ME2115,I am in the same boat too! Need solutions for part 1 qns,"Since u''re year 2 EE, explaining CS2030 and CS2040 workload in terms of EE mods is easier. CS2030 is somewhat similar to EE2026 workload. In 2026 u have 4 lab assignments in increasing time consumption. Total time spent on the 10 CS2030 labs is slightly higher than 4 2026 labs, but the difference is that difficulty of CS2030 labs are roughly equal (u suffer roughly equally throughout the sem), while EE2026 labs increase difficulty by 1.5-2 times every time. 

Both CS2030 (under Prof Henry) and EE2026 have projects, and both projects are released around 2nd half of semester, I would say EE2026 project is more time consuming, but this may be due to 2026 being more open-ended and I put in a lot of effort. On the other hand 2030 project is fixed with fixed test cases. I suspect that if u put average effort for EE2026 project the workload would be only slightly higher than CS2030 project. Other than that, time taken for lecture, tutorials and revising more or less similar. Only difference is that 2026 has 1 midterms but 2030 has 2 PEs (no midterms). IMO the time spent on the extra PE2 for cs2030 is balanced out by the higher project workload for EE2026.

Notice that I didn''t mention estimate time for each component becos obviously the time spent varies for diff ppl. But chances are, if u suffer and spent a lot of time debugging ur EE2026 assignments and project, likely u''ll do the same for CS2030. And if u''re the type that completes ur EE2026 assignment and project quickly, CS2030 labs and project will be quick for u too.

CS2040 lab workload is similar to CS2030. CS2040 does not have project, but more time will be spent on understanding algo concepts + practice or prepare for tests. Overall CS2040 has lower workload than CS2030 but not by a lot.

TLDR: Workload of CS2030 is similar to EE2026. CS2040 is slightly lower","Actually it’s pretty hard to comment on the difficulty cuz everyone learns quite differently.

MNO3703 is a deeper delving into leadership styles.

We then balloted for our group presentations at the end. 

MNO3702 is based on negotiation cases, so you will play different scenarios in class each week to apply the different concepts such as reservation points and stuff. You therefore have a chance to find and hone your own negotiation style, and be exposed to other unique approaches.

You can also look through the past papers set by the same prof, cause they will usually test similar questions.","Rudin''s book is not easy to understand, so if you ever plan on trying it, either be prepared to spend alot more time and effort on it, or not understand what it is saying.

459,MA2116,"This one is a unique case but I think its more helpful to think of the preclusion as one-way instead of going both ways. That is, the Econs department is okay if you take ST2334 and ST3131 (R) in place of EC2303 and EC3303 (stata). Reason is because EC3303 uses stata which is only useful for econometric analysis. If you go and apply for internships you''ll see that employers want students with proficiency in either R or python. The Econs department recognises that, and given the rigour of ST2234 and ST3131 provided by the Math department, are okay with students doing that instead. So instead of the usual EC2303 --> EC3303 --> EC3304 route, you can take ST2334 --> ST3131 --> EC3304.

On the other hand, my guess is that the math department wants you to take ST2234 for the minor in mathematical finance because you will re-visit some of that knowledge in ST3131. So you might die trying to jump from EC2303 to ST3131. That, or they may feel that the rigour in EC2303 provided by the Econs department does not match up to ST2234.","Foremost this is Abit off topic and secondly, I want to apologise if I sound offputing / rude. 

I think is just that math in JC / highschool is very calculus centric so we tend to feel like real analysis is the be-all-end-all of mathematics. So the cliche saying you can''t say you studied maths if you haven''t encountered xxx is like such a lame reason to justify to study something. I can also say the same for almost every topic 😂😂

Okay secondly, saying that all other maths is accessible because you learned some real analysis is very misleading. Maybe you meant to say that one would have more practice at trying to learn new definitions so you wouldn''t have an absolutely terrible time, but sometimes, you still do have an absolutely dogshit time if you don''t know what the objective of the topic is, or the textbook is written in a overly rigorous manner / written full of gaps for yourself to fill in. 

Finally, is good that you are able to pick up topology easily. But I suspect that the reason you''re able to do so is because you studied some real analysis, and topology is just an abstraction of concepts you may have otherwise encountered in analysis (open set vs epsilon delta continuity, compactness vs Heine borel) and so you have a concrete model of otherwise very abstract concepts in topology.","Ok to elaborate why I think studying real analysis well makes other branches more accessible is because if we understand the topics well, it means that you have reached a certain level of mathematical maturity. For example, understanding epsilon delta proofs would indicate some form of mathematical maturity, since it''s likely most math encountered till that point does not require such thinking.

 There are of course many ways to reach this, but for a beginner, I feel real analysis is a promising starting point as it bridges the gap between calculus and the mindset needed to approach more abstract problems. At the very least, the terms seen in real analysis should be somewhat familiar compared to say algebra 


Of course, I agree with you that a good textbook or instructor is needed, or else you won''t really know what''s going on or what''s the point of learning this. For example, when I took LA 2 back then, I really had no idea why I''m learning the things I learnt, or what''s the end goal of learning and proving those (at that point in time) seemingly random lemmas and theorems. A good textbook (and ideally, teacher) is needed to point you to the right stuff to focus on. And for a beginner, it''s important to know what is important to understand, and which of the finer details can be ''abstracted'' away to avoid losing sight of the big picture.",4.56,0,"0.93,7.34,24.15,13.08,54.5"

461,MA2401,">1K: GEA1000

You can do other Data Literacy modules (eg DSA1101, ST1131, etc.) instead. In fact, other Data Literacy mods are probably more in depth than GEA1000, so they might be a better choice if u want to pursue this minor I guess

>However, DSA3361 requires these four mods as prerequisites; GEA1000, MA2401 (which I will already be required to take within the minor) as well as MA2002 and ST2131. However, the module MA2401''s preclusions include the module MA2002 which means if I take MA2002 first (which I intended to), I won''t be able to take MA2401. 

I believe you are reading the NUSMods prereq tree. As stated on NUSMods:

> The prerequisite tree is displayed for visualization purposes and may not be accurate. Viewers are encouraged to double check details.

If you read the prerequisites for the module, the prerequisites are: (I''ve added paragraphing for clarity) 

> {GEA1000 Quantitative Reasoning with Data or GER1000 Quantitative Reasoning or DSA1101 Introduction to Data Science or DSE1101 Introductory Data Science for Economics or ST1131 Introduction to Statistics and Statistical Computing} and 
>
>MA2401 Introductory Mathematics with R 
>
>MA2401 may be replaced by three modules as follows:
>
> - One module from MA1101R, MA1311, MA1508E, MA1513, or MA2001; and 
>
>- One module from MA1102R, MA1312, MA1505, MA1507, MA1511, MA1521, or MA2002; and
>
> - One module from MA2216/MA2116/ST2131 or ST2334

As such, you can fulfil prereqs with just GEA1000 and MA2401.

Wrt DSA3362, it is actually on NUSMods here: https://nusmods.com/modules/DSA3362/predictive-data-analytics

The reason why you probably couldn''t find it was because DSA3362 is not offered this AY and the default search filters of NUSMods only show modules offered this AY

CS2030 is somewhat similar to EE2026 workload. In 2026 u have 4 lab assignments in increasing time consumption. Total time spent on the 10 CS2030 labs is slightly higher than 4 2026 labs, but the difference is that difficulty of CS2030 labs are roughly equal (u suffer roughly equally throughout the sem), while EE2026 labs increase difficulty by 1.5-2 times every time. 

Both CS2030 (under Prof Henry) and EE2026 have projects, and both projects are released around 2nd half of semester, I would say EE2026 project is more time consuming, but this may be due to 2026 being more open-ended and I put in a lot of effort. On the other hand 2030 project is fixed with fixed test cases. I suspect that if u put average effort for EE2026 project the workload would be only slightly higher than CS2030 project. Other than that, time taken for lecture, tutorials and revising more or less similar. Only difference is that 2026 has 1 midterms but 2030 has 2 PEs (no midterms). IMO the time spent on the extra PE2 for cs2030 is balanced out by the higher project workload for EE2026.

Notice that I didn''t mention estimate time for each component becos obviously the time spent varies for diff ppl. But chances are, if u suffer and spent a lot of time debugging ur EE2026 assignments and project, likely u''ll do the same for CS2030. And if u''re the type that completes ur EE2026 assignment and project quickly, CS2030 labs and project will be quick for u too.

CS2040 lab workload is similar to CS2030. CS2040 does not have project, but more time will be spent on understanding algo concepts + practice or prepare for tests. Overall CS2040 has lower workload than CS2030 but not by a lot.

1. If you''re going into geospatial related work this will be an advantage, I have friends who have gone to intern / work at places like JTC, URA, LTA, MPA for their geospatial skills.

* a. I wouldn''t say there''s high transferability unless you''re doing the GIS mods e.g. GE2215 to GE3238 
* b. I think it would be good if you''re able to handle both urban studies minor + GIS minor. The technical skills you learn will definitely give you an advantage if you want to purse a planning related career. As half of the modules for both minors are under Geography anyway you won''t really have to go out of your way to clear them since you''ll be taking 2k and 3k mods that count to your major requirement too so you can kill two birds with one stone.

2. GE2101 is doable, don''t worry it''s very straightforward. Just the stats bit of H2 Math. If anything, form a study group with other people in the major, you''ll be fine.

* a. Knowing some coding language would be useful for the minor if you want to continue to use it in the future. CS1010S is one of the modules you can take to count towards the GIS requirement too so maybe consider it. I didn''t take it but I know it''s hellish, find some friends to ~~suffer~~ take it with you 
* b. I''m not very techy myself but you''re here in uni to explore new things. I would suggest that you take GE2215 and see if GIS is your cup of tea, if not, don''t force it. It''s okay if your plans change, trust me, it''ll all work out somehow.

3. As I stated before, don''t force it if it''s not your cup of tea. 

Hope my two cents helps, PM if you need more help for the minor or anything else!","Do a Google search NUS Sociology modules review and there''ll be a few blogs by students who write reviews of the Soci modules that they have taken. Though just take note that some modules may be taught by a different prof so the content and assessment may be different. Some of the modules that you listed are also quite new.

In my experience it doesn''t really matter when you complete SC3101 as the other modules don''t really utilise the content from that. I cleared the module in Y2S2. I think some even try to clear it during SEP, though that should be something that you check with the department. What''s more important for SC3101 is that they rotate the profs every semester, so you should look up which profs'' assessment styles are suitable for you through the reviews. I did mine under Prof Liang.

I did take Emotions before under Prof Radics when i was in Y1S2. Weeks 1-6 is the theory part while the remaining weeks will be covering the different kinds of emotions. Kind of straightforward I feel, but it is one of the more popular 2k modules so be prepared with the bell curve possibly.","Hi OP, seeing you haven’t had many replies, here’s my two cents. Not from FASS but I cleared the GIS minor, mainly for interest, though I didn’t pursue a related career in the end. 

GIS is definitely a good and relevant software to learn but you can just take the GIS mods as a geog student without clearing the minor - no need to take stats / cs electives. The 3 GIS mods aren’t enough to prepare you for a GIS career though, so you probably need to practise more elsewhere. 

I took ST1131 - found it easier than H2 maths and shares similar content with GER1000. I also took CS1010S which I really enjoyed even though it was super intense and time consuming. It’s a beginner-level module, but it would help if you have a good sense of logic and order. I spent 80% of my time on it and sacrificed my other mods. Still worth it though, one of the best mods I’ve taken in uni.

In terms of employability, I don’t think the minor does much, as long as you can show that you know how to use the software well, you’re on the same level as a minor holder (I may be wrong, please get a second opinion). That said, if you’re gonna take most of the minor mods anyway, then just do it for that line on your transcript. (what I did)

Academia and postgrad in GIS would likely require you to do lots of statistical / quantitative analyses.

540,SP2271,"Hi! To answer your question, the modules are not very very difficult to the point where you will consider dropping the modules.

If you have heard horror stories from current / ex-SPS students about heavy workload, I would like to clarify that that is because the students put in more effort into their work than what we expect of them. Eg, a commenter in this post said something about a group doing chaos theory for their coding project. This project was going above and beyond what was expected of them according to the rubrics. 

For the module specific details, I''m sorry I can''t reveal everything about them so here''s some stuff I can:

For SP2271, since you''re going to be exposed to effectively reading scientific literature, you are expected to write abstracts to show that you''ve understood the literature to some degree. This is going to be a little time consuming if the scientific topic you chose is a little unfamiliar to you and uses too many technical terms. You''ll also be trained in presentation techniques (which imo im still using even when I''m y4).

For SP2274, there would be wet labs that are a little more Life Sciences based. But do not worry! Student mentors will be posted during the lab as TAs to guide you even if you do not have any biology background! If you do have biology background, this module shouldn''t be too difficult :)

For SP2273, as with any coding module. A little of python knowledge beforehand goes a long way. For students who haven''t touched coding at all, obviously it is going to be a little daunting. But, the lecturer and the student TAs would always be contactable at various platforms to answer all questions you have about code! I cant say definitively about the workload for this module as it really depends from person to person ://

Regarding your last point of how many non-sps students are taking these modules, we can''t say! Because we genuinely have no idea. Last year there were only a handful because of a flurry of administrative issues, so we''re expecting way more this year!!

Speaking of, these three modules, SP2271, SP2274 and SP2273 are open to ALL CHS students, you do not need to be in SPS to take them to fulfil your CHS common curriculum!

Source: Sps mentor","I took SP2273 as a non-sps last semester. Out of the 50+ students in the module, only a handful are non-sps. The mod, like any other computing mod is time-consuming but in terms of programming, I find it less daunting than CS1010S. However, the science portion of this module is VERY HEAVY so if you do not have knowledge in math/chem/bio/biochem/physics it may be really difficult because this module integrates science and computing.

Edit: The group project requires you and your group to code up an entire python notebook based on science ground up sooooooooo. The SPS students are really insane I literally have no idea what their notebook was on about, they did the topic on chaos theory, I had a lot of difficulty understanding both their code and their science when doing peer grading.",Nope.

Dr Murphy is really patient about questions so if you don’t know anything, you can ask her. Dr Murphy imo is a pretty fair marker. She will give you the grades if your answers deserve it. But I guess it can be hard for many because they are uncertain of how to answer the questions. I took it on the first online sem, so we have online test, and there’s no practice paper to find. So many didn’t know what kind of questions to expect. The only instruction was that it’s based on lecture contents. It’s all essay based, 3 qns in 2 hrs, each abt 400-500 words. However, with all the difficulty of the module, I still think it’s a very satisfying feeling to complete the module especially completing a full short performance. Feel free to dm me if you have any more questions! :)","Hmmm it depends on the schedule of you and your group mates. But to get a rough gauge:

Performance 1: week 7
You will have week 6 and recess week to practice. Length of text will be one scene of the text Undercover. About 5-8 mins. No lighting or sound required so it’s fully acting with props and costumes. 

For performance 2: there will be a graded work in progress performance in week 11 and final in week 13.
You will be given the text on week 8 to prep. Week 11 no need lights and sounds. Week 13 need. The performance should be 15 - 20 mins long if I rmb correctly. 2 choice of texts but it changes every sem. 

If you got the roles with more lines than be prepared to spend more time memorizing too.

For marking wise, a lot didn’t do well for mid-terms, like the ppl arnd me I knew ranges around b- to fail. I was fortunate to get A-, so I think it’s possible to do well. My paper wasn’t marked by dr Murphy but a tutor who left alr. They don’t release the final test grades. But I know that my friends eventually got decent grades like B or B+ cos their acting component saved them. Ohhh there’s also a performance review of 1000 words to write. Basically, they will ask you to buy ticket to watch an actual live performance with student discount and write on it. This assignment can also be a grade saver if you do it correctly.",NULL,5.61,0,"15.42,12.94,18.41,10.95,42.29"

The readings are very easy to digest as it’s very relatable compared to the other topics like posthuman and all. Your final paper requires you to look for primary resources and i did 2 interviews with a course mate and a prof. Very easy to find interviewees or survey responds as they are all around you. For the prof, her teaching style is very traditional English teacher in secondary sch. She taught English at secondary long time ago so perhaps that explains her vibe. But she is very motherly and patient and nice, I personally feel that her marking was quite lenient too. Can easily get a decent B+ and above if you put some effort to it! Her class also isn’t intimidating. Very nice learning environment overall.",NULL,NULL,6.5,0,"12,6,25,19,38"

119,DAO1704,"hello! i took this mod last sem and ur feelings are justified bc this mod was truly death for me. For some background, I''m hopeless in math/data stuff lol, and DAO is all abt that so u can imagine.... 

I tried to contribute most to the weekly group assignments, and my group usually gets full marks/close to full marks. So those saved my final grade. For the project I wrote most of the report, excel analysis was done by my groupmates simply bc idk how to. 

If you really want to get a good grade (not S/U), I suggest going over topic by topic and redoing the questions in the lectures, group assignments, past year papers. Then consult on qns udk/don''t understand. 

For finals I probably got 30% of the paper correct. Rest I couldn''t answer/half answered. In the end my final grade was C and I S/Ued it. So don''t give up, this too shall pass haha",can cuz im quite sure thats what i got last sem for the finals paper but still ended up with a C dont worry mate u got this!!,">if dao1704 exams require the knowledge of excel functions

Yes, there will be questions in the exam where you are required leave your answer in terms of excel formula.

>whats the exam format like,

Questions on probability, stats, decision tree, optimization. It is not an exam that requires much qualitative answers.",4.56,2,"0,0.71,37,7,55.29"

"Personally, it was manageable doing in the same semester. I suppose these math mods are all about practice! The workload was manageable, just have to be consistent. And you do have SU to utilise if need be.",Joy,8,,,Joy,47,31.33333333,,1,25,10
"I thought it would be super difficult with many proof questions, so i practised to prove every theorem in the textbook and finished all exercise questions. Then it turned out that 70% of the paper(qn1-3) is all about computation, which is really difficult for me as i am careless and i didn't spend much time on practising calculating. So i spent most of my time working on qn1-3, which made me had insufficient time to finish qn4, but i still got qn2 and 3 wrong.",Sad,3,,,Sad,22,14.66666667,,2,25,10

"From what I know, it is very hard to fail, provided you put in some effort. 30% is probably a good estimate to get D (but of course, aim for higher, like 35%). Bell curve will likely save you and give you a D (or better, hopefully). So, don't worry. Good luck!",Joy,6,,,Neutral ,39,26,,4,25,10
"is it just me or is this mod just insanely difficult? The prof literally just reads out all the definitions/theorems(and there are so many of them) and this chapter is finished. Uni math is already difficult and now with this prof who cannot teach AT ALL, kill me. It's nothing like A level math, and it's worse than linear algebra which I am also taking this sem. It's taking a toll on my mental wellness and now I just want to get a D and s/u, anyone has any idea how many % you need for a D?",Anger,1,,,Surprise,10,6.666666667,,5,25,10
I feel you. It's not just the definitions that's hard. It's that they give the equation in some weird form and were expected to big brain it into a form that can be integrated. Some of the steps are so out there I don't know how it's even possible to come up with it.,Anger,2,,,Fear,13,8.666666667,,6,25,10

"I dropped it this semester before recess week as I couldn't keep up and really cmi (poly background). The bellcurve though... I dk how is everyone getting close to full marks for every quiz unless they discussed with one another or just 200 IQ. The test 1 that I took before recess week, I only got like 35/50 and I was happy till I saw the bellcurve for test 1.... ridiculous and I am sure that ppl cheated for this test since the zoom recording only required us to show our faces....",Fear,4,,,,,,,,250,
"is a great mod I’ve taken in NUS. Profs introduce so much fascinating facts and trivia about the way Singapore is organised. If you hate writing, dont fret, writing has been reduced I guess. Forgot the profs’ names but their passion for Singapore is amazing. Superb mod I must say when I took it in 2018",Joy,10,,,,,,,,,
"read the readings, they are quite lengthy but very enjoyable. Tutorials are pretty chill. There’s a group project work during my time that required us to do fieldtrip about a significant place, the changes around the place etc. A fruitful one for me",Joy,8,,,,,,,Average Rating,5.5,
"assessments were all MCQ/MRQ using Examplify. Group project was to design a poster on mangrove species No tutorials, just 2 sessions of lectures per week which can be viewed on Luminus anytime, quite a chill mod imo I rmb it was quite popular on modreg",Joy,9,,,,,,,,,
"workload was ok, you just have to attend lectures, no tutorials. the mcq test had ~50 i think qns but open book, and tests only things before recess break. the profs were super nice as well, very approachable and helpful.",Joy,7,,,,,,,,,
"It’s pretty interesting content, and quite fun and manageable, so you can consider looking into it too, just that there are readings for you to draw examples during your midterms and finals",Joy,8,,,,,,,,,
"I agree, the number of readings was pretty manageable, usually one compulsory reading at most. There are some recommended (i.e. optional) readings too. But be sure to read the compulsory ones carefully! Although the MCQ exams are pretty simple, some minor facts of hair-splitting specifics are only derived from the readings. The articles or essays assigned are usually rather easy, anyway, which is surprising for works that date back as far as the 1800s -- so you might as well read them :) I loved the module a lot and just took it in the last sem (AY20/21 Sem 1), so feel free to ask any questions here or in messages!",Neutral ,9,,,,,,,,,
"I've never felt so helpless in my life, and so stressed out, and on top of it all, alone. I am finding it harder and harder to focus on my work, things are really building up upon me, and I think mental health and confidence is taking a big hit.",Sad,1,,,,,,,,,
"I am barely meeting deadlines when I'm studying every day, and if i cut down my studying I might just end up stressing more. I used to be able to clock some exercise days but with weekly assignments it's quite difficult.",Sad,2,,,,,,,,,
"Is it just me or like I just can’t grasp the content in this module? Like the whole proofing and logic part. Even after spending more than 6 hours to a day constantly rewatching lectures and online YouTube tutorials, I still can’t do almost all of the tutorial questions? Now I’m constantly doubting whether I’m just dumb or not. At this rate, I’m sure I’m gonna flunk this mod super badly. I really need help and advise on this.",Fear,2,,,,,,,,,
"Assignment 2 was okay but prepare to do some self learning for assignment 1. From the result we got this sem prof seems to be quite lenient in his grading, but if your group cannot even finish it on time then it’s another story",Neutral ,5,,,,,,,,,
I do not have any prior knowledge abt java but the prof is q good at teaching so I don’t feel it difficult to catch up,Joy,7,,,,,,,,,
"The introductory CS mods in NUS is one of the most useful class that you can take. Like many things in life, hard work pays off and you won't regret the result.",Joy,7,,,,,,,,,
There are actually quite a significant percentage of students who can get full marks or close to full marks for 2040 hence the steep bell curve. This is usually the case for more independent technical mods.,Neutral ,5,,,,,,,,,
"It’ll definitely be very helpful, especially for beginners to programming. It teaches you OOP which at most companies is the default way to write code, but it also teaches functional programming which is gaining popularity",Neutral ,6,,,,,,,,,
"Since you have prior experience, it won’t be that bad. I took it without any experience and struggled a lot with the weekly labs and the project. It is ultimately a very useful module but definitely one of the toughest modules I’ve taken so far. It’s kinda expected that the programming methodology modules will consume majority of your time if you don’t have programming experience, so the module isn’t for people who aren’t willing to devote a lot of time to it.",Sad,5,,,,,,,,,
"Took it last sem and for me, it was manageable, and I would say enjoyable even. You just have to be disciplined and start on the labs early, never underestimate the amount of time you need to finish the lab. Me and my friends started on every lab the day they were released and just spent the entire day doing it. My TAs were also quite helpful and would help nudge me in the right direction whenever I'm stuck. Once you get the lab over and done with, there's really nothing much else to do for the mod over the rest of the week. I didn't really have a problem with the teaching as well: it wasn't the best, the lectures were mostly reused from past years but given the covid situation, I think it is understandable.",Joy,6,,,,,,,,,
"Acc workload is pretty chill. 1 lecture & tutorial class per week plus a group project & final exam. Just remember to do your weekly self-study questions & revision, if not you may lag behind. All the best!",Joy,6,,,,,,,,,
dry and can be quite abstract. Assessments are writing based which can also be quite difficult for the ones who are not good at writing.,Sad,3,,,,,,,,,
"extremely chill and really interesting, Bell curve not that bad and exams were not too difficult",Joy,8,,,,,,,,,
"not particularly interesting, but the knowledge gained from the module with regards to climate change is very useful.",Joy,6,,,,,,,,,
"super chill mod, 2MCs, if u are a CS student or know programming you’ll basically Smurf the mod. No bell curve cause class size is small. Basically 0 workload besides the assignments which can be completed in less than a day.",Joy,10,,,,,,,,,
"is known to be difficult, so don’t fret! I recommend that you go through the past year papers to get a sensing of what type of questions they like to ask. Also do note that the style of the questions may have slightly changed around 2 years ago as Prof Tan took over from Prof Ben as the lecturer around then, so it may be advisable to try the recent 2 papers first.",Surprise,7,,,,,,,,,
"What you described is what I faced 3 years ago - missions are manageable, papers are what-the-fuck. What the prof said back then was because have graduates come back and take 1010X to upskill, so he made it harder - which sort of didn't make sense to me cos don't the graduates have full-time jobs to worry about - so they have less time and energy to code?",Anger,4,,,,,,,,,
"To be honest, I felt that this sem CS3230 papers might have be relatively easier compared to the previous sems. Surprisingly not as hard to score as I had imagined it to be, especially with the technically free marks he gives out.",Surprise,9,,,,,,,,,
"i totally feel you! while some ppl are smart, i believe many others get past ans from seniors or friends which is why they can answer so damn fast!!! i hope your prof is kind and gives low CP ppl a chance tho :,) also, only certain topics r tested for finals and the structures is kinda the same over the years so focus on the right stuff for that and you're good to go!! and SU wisely hehehe",Joy,8,,,,,,,,,
"Class part felt ok, I spoke up once every class or so. This is relatively easy as there are many class part opportunities in lecture, mini project and final project presentations. The content of this mod is very manageable, but this mod requires you to be hardworking. To do well, you need to put in effort to do well in all the components which can be time consuming.",Neutral ,7,,,,,,,,,
"The prof really is one of the best few I had in my 3 semester in NUS! Compared to the later AH mods, the lecture readings pretty chill tbh because you don’t necessarily have to read as the slides are suffice for the test (30%). The test only cover 3 lectures contents so there’s not much to memorize and the prof will highlight which artworks to study and you just have to read the tutorial readings (very minimal, 10 to 20 pgs long) and keep talking in class to get the free 40% grade",Joy,10,,,,,,,,,
"I have troubles with being able to meet the basic level drawings because I’m really not proficient in that. But this issue is more about being able to produce your ideas and make them into drawings. I’m just having issue with translating ideas into drawing. For the workload of Design 1, this really needs you to be able to put a lot of time and effort into the assignments. For us Architecture students, our whole life in school just revolves around that one module. The rest of the modules get kinda pushed to the side because of how much time and effort is put into the design module. This really depends on how much you enjoy the module. If you can’t cope with the stress, it won’t work out for you",Fear,3,,,,,,,,,
"Interesting module :) Didn't spend too much on it due to overloading but did pretty decent (B+). I think it's not too hard to do well if you generally can write decently. I remembered I could choose anything I wanted to write for the final essay, as long as its related to American history. I learnt quite a bit abt US history, but didnt really keep up a lot with the lectures and readings",Surprise,7,,,,,,,,,

"Please, please try to avoid him as much as possible, because He is very confusing in teaching, giving projects, and setting exam papers. The project is to find any dataset, form any hypothesis, and no grading rubrics given at all. You will be very confused along the way regardless of your grasp of concepts taught, because you do not know what professor wants. Even if you feel that you have a strong foundation in linear regression and statistics (i.e.: you can self-learn everything and grasp the concepts well), his exam paper is going to make you so confused that you do not even know what he is trying to ask. Awkward and misleading phrasing are going to be everywhere in the exam papers and slides. Can't imagine how the grading will be like as I can imagine our answers are going to be all over the place. sigh",Anger,1,,,,,,,,,
"depends on how good you are in stats - id say the workload is relatively okay if you took stats before but you might need to spend more time on it if you haven't done stats before. also just watch out for the finals, can be pretty intense but pray for bell curve HAHA",Neutral ,4,,,,,,,,,

"Personally I dropped the module mid-sem since I already had my own resume/was busy with other modules.People might say that it’s a free 2 MCs but I would rather spend the time/effort on modules that actually matter, because 1002 does have deliverables as well. No matter how simple the deliverables, it’s an additional “burden” you need to handle, needing to remember deadlines, watch the videos, clearing of quizzes etc etc.Take the module if you really want the “expert” guidance on resume crafting, cover letter writing etc. But then again, Google’s the best teacher for these kinda things.",Surprise,4,,,,,,,,,
"i think it was quite enjoyable but i’m just not a movie person so it was a bit sian to watch 10 movies for a module 🥺 but compared to the other asian studies mod, ch1101e workload q chill bc no readings HAHA pm me if u wanna ask about grades",Surprise,6,,,,,,,,,
"I think it’s quite interesting. Tutorials are on odd/even weeks and i find it quite intriguing to discuss with others and hear opinions about the characters from movies watched. We had to do a presentation and a paper on the movie we were assigned to and every week you have to watch movies in order to take part in class discussion (15%). Overall workload was decent, especially if you have group mates that are efficient. He made lectures interesting and he’s quite a funny prof. I would rate it a 9/10.",Joy,10,,,,,,,,,
"probably the hardest cuz you dont really have ""free"" assignments or projects to buffer your score. so how well you do in the midterm quizzes/finals directly affects your final grade. it's also the most tedious and content heavy 3k mod although it's really useful in understanding separation processes and sets the groundwork",Fear,4,,,,,,,,,
The exam was last Wednesday but can I just ask what the hell was going on???? Am I the only one who didn’t know what in the world was going on for the last few questions. The two chem exams this sem were just train wrecks...,Anger,3,,,,,,,,,
"Its generally a doable module with only theory and exams. There's no lab. Personally for me, it was difficult at the start bc I was still getting used to school. As a result I did pretty badly for midterms. But when the second half of the semester came it became a lot easier. Also I feel the content in the 2nd half of the semester is better (and more interesting). I had Prof Sarada and I think she's really good. Very willing to help you out 1-to-1 consult. In terms of workload, it's not too bad: weekly tutorials that are relatively doable.",Neutral ,5,,,,,,,,,
is fun cos it had weekly labs which makes it easy to make friends. The experiments are fun and v enjoyable.,Joy,8,,,,,,,,,
"It'll mostly be people who won't need to use programming for their major, so the concepts taught aren't difficult. Labs mostly just copy paste code from lecture.",Surprise,5,,,,,,,,,
"someone who really sucks at coding even feels really hard for me especially since the first take home assignment will be released this weekend and i’m feeling very stressed over it 😭😭 am i the only one who feels that they didn’t really teach much coding in the lab lecture videos and the concepts in lectures are quite hard to grasp as well, i do feel like i’m struggling quite a bit in the mod, really just trying my best to at least complete the weekly lab notebooks, quizzes and project and hopefully won’t have to remod even if i do badly for the take home assignments 😭😭",Sad,2,,,,,,,,,
"The assignments are just downright hell for me, it has come to a point where I completely don't know what is going on, because rather than actually making u learn, the assignments are made to ""prove your worth"". Favouring those who has had past experiences coding. Of course I have no choice but to rely on my assignments given my shitty single digit mid term results and going to be bad PE results, and even then I don't know whether I can pass this module. I am so done being burnt out, I have been crying since friday morning and I couldn't sleep Friday night because I don't know what to do anymore, I hate all my modules and I especially hate CS1010. The whole approach of it being beginner friendly whilst throwing these kind of assignment questions is just inhumane to me, who has had no coding experience before.",Sad,1,,,,,,,,,
"that's bullshit, why should I indulge myself in something which is making my mental health so bad to the extent when I wake up I'm unhappy I'm alive? If I fail this mod, I don't know what I am gonna do. I really don't. I'm sick of the assignments, the tests, the way the prof teaches the topics, everything. I hate this and I hate my life.",Anger,1,,,,,,,,,
"say i bombed it pretty badly. i studied so hard over recess week for this 10% midterms and did past year papers only to get rekt so badly? i don't even know what i'm doing wrong. when i saw the average, i was already preparing myself but i did not prepare to fail THIS badly. fr, i'm done with this mod. The weekly assignments, heavy workload and exams. i'm sick and tired of the secrecy and the reluctance of giving answers and explanations for mock midterms (and everything else). the only resources are the notes, a QnA forum which is IMHO not very helpful, and google. The mentality of 'breaking us down to build us up' is just draining. there is not one day i don't go without thinking about this mod. i'm burnt out from this one mod and i don't want to repeat it but i don't know what to do from here. i have no idea how to bounce back and pass this mod. i have nvr felt this stupid. the way it is taught is so dry and uninteresting",Sad,1,,,,,,,,,
"bruh i’m just lost. like my prof is good and seems really open to consultation but i just cannot deal with this module 🤡 i’m so so confused in every single class and i don’t even know what i don’t know so how to consult. ur feelings are justified bc this mod was truly death for me. For some background, I'm hopeless in math/data stuff lol, and DAO is all abt that so u can imagine.... i am way too far behind and i really can’t catch up at all😭 i have zero clue what’s gg on so i’m just doing my best for the project and assignments and i’m just gna hope i can s/u this :’)",Sad,2,,,,,,,,,
"In fairness, I’m fairly confident that I did well in other grade components like group projects, tutorials, assignments, class part, etc. For my finals revision, I really did try my hardest but it all came crashing down due to the pressure of the exam environment and format... I’ve just been so depressed about it, I feel like my efforts have just gone to waste...",Sad,2,,,,,,,,,
"I made the unfortunate choice of taking this module in AY21/22 Semester 1 and it's no doubt the worst module I've taken. As a final year student at NUS, I've never had a professor who is not only too lazy to conduct her module properly, but also seem to have a personal vendetta against her student. This is going to be a rather lengthy post detailing her method of conducting the module and her attitude towards me but She was unnecessarily rude when I pointed out a typo on the slides. She doesn't bother planning the assignments she gives in advance. She gives 0 for submission if you name your file wrongly. She was too lazy to use LumiNUS properly. The most absurd of all: she accused me of lying",Anger,1,,,,,,,,,
"Took the same mod this sem, actually found her to be ok despite some questionable actions here and there eg. not providing answers for sample exam paper as she was ‘too busy’, being super vague about the final exam format and being super anal about the file naming etc.. personally still felt that her teaching was good with lots of class part, case studies and even a game (that lasted 2 weeks, which meant 2 weeks less content for finals yay) Finals were doable too, gave her a decent score for the prof review and got a decent grade in the end too",Surprise,3,,,,,,,,,
Hey me too! My experience was around the same as yours. Was actually quite shocked to find this out. I thoroughly enjoyed the seminars with her and when I clarified things with her she is very nice and explained things well. Yeah the sample exam one was quite fishy but tbh she could have just said she did not want to release answers for privacy issue etc. & I would understand. The file naming one was quite scary but luckily my eye never cock up and everything was quite smooth.,Surprise,4,,,,,,,,,
"is a free 4MC mod where you SHOULD really get A/A+ easily (although it has a lot of math and I'm more inclined towards it, so take this with a bit of salt). Workload wise, it's the lightest workload module I took (you'll also probably only spend ~ 2 hours each weekend reviewing on top of the lecture timings).",Joy,2,,,,,,,,,
My biggest L in university so far is not taking GEQ when I could. Instead I’m suffering with this absolutely useless mod. The amount of effort needed is insane. Imagine spending CNY doing some retarded creative exercise lmao,Anger,2,,,,,,,,,
"Taking this mod this sem where they said they 'significantly reduced the workload' as compared to last sem. If this is the reduced workload, I cannot fathom the amount of pain and misery the people who took this last sem went through. Took it last sem. Neaely cried my eyes out doing the stupid projects. I wanted to pull my hair out while doing this over CNY. Then I realized that I have SUs left to spare. So I deleted the homework file, closed my laptop and waltzed out of my house feeling like a champ.",Sad,1,,,,,,,,,
I thought the point of intro mods was to ease students into learning the curriculum and also to bridge the guys who spent 2 years serving the nation back into studying… then out of the blue the midterms sudd had this crazy time limit. Or am I just dumb idk man,Surprise,3,,,,,,,,,
"beware of steep bell curve (it's pure MCQ so you probably need full marks from midterms and do extremely well for finals to get an A+) and no I wouldn't think its sufficient to just focus during lectures to get A+ because readings are tested and there's usually QUITE A FEW EVERY WEEK. Some are pretty factual and easier to remember imo e.g. the newspaper articles in the problem sets, while some are just full of fluff e.g. those she takes from the book (Sorry Dr Ong). During closed-book exams nitty gritty stuff such as ""In xxx reading, which policies were used effectively to tackle xxx problem?"" and all the options were actually covered in the reading, you need to recall which specific ones were actually effective. And also the application of concepts can get tricky, expect some weird questions you've never seen before in exams e.g. 3 strategy game theory question etc. So yeah while I think that content is pretty manageable (if you took Econs in JC there's quite a bit of overlap), it's hard to get a really good grade because of some tricky questions which are meant to differentiate the bell curve.",Neutral ,4,,,,,,,,,
"The workload isn't that bad and still manageable, in my opinion. There are just readings for each week's class that you have to do in order to be able to do the reading quizzes in class; then there are just two midterms and a final exam/take-home final CA.",Neutral ,6,,,,,,,,,
"it's a module on basic syntax. if you found el1101e under dr leslie lee a breeze and an easy A, you'll most likely find (which is also under dr leslie lee) almost as easy, based on my own personal experience. I did have friends who struggled just a little bit more though so take my personal experience with a grain of salt. you'll also be able to find the workload and content of the module through LumiNUS' module search engine.",Joy,7,,,,,,,,,
I’ll highly recommend it! The mod was taught by Prof Starr when I took it and her explanations were extremely clear and simple so it was very easily understandable for someone like me who doesn’t have any background. Mine were mainly pre-recorded lectures and the assignments/exams were open-book application questions fo test your understanding of the content.

Fass allows u to do so, and gives u s/u options too, if things go south in spite of ur best attempts. Anyways is a good time to take if you have had no experience with lit.

"this was one of the easiest mods to get A for, I decided to put in my effort to try and at least get a good grade for it. This turned out to be true though because I did manage to get an A- in the end. The mod is very structured and doesn’t have a steep bellcurve from what I know (because most people just aim to SU it). All you have to do is consistently do your assignments using what the tutors taught (they’ll give marks accordingly), and you should be able to score well easily (Just don’t sleep in class haha). Luckily I had a fun tutor last sem which really made the sessions pretty fun and lively so do try your best to participate in class because it does get boring listening sometimes, usually I just cracked random jokes in class though ahaha. Overall, I think the content they teach is actually quite useful and it trains you on how to write/structure your academic essays. I’m taking 3K FASS mods now and I really think this mod helped me to structure my essay/sentences more logically haha. So dont feel discouraged about it and use this as a learning opportunity! :) feel free to pm me if u have more questions haha",Joy,10,,,,,,,,,
"can fulfill UEM requirement and it is very helpful in learning academic writing techniques. It is quite an eye opener. I took it few weeks back during special term I. Learn how to use apa style in text end text citation, sources, hyper themes, macro themes, how to write a argumentative essay, introduction, body, conclusion etc, how to link one paragraph to another, toolkits to write better academic writings and alot more useful you will learn along the way. I will say it is indeed helpful =)",Joy,9,,,,,,,,,
"can be challenging if you have no Python knowledge, especially for the exams and group project, but since it's bell curved and most of the cohort don't know much about programming you can probably pass",Neutral ,5,,,,,,,,,
"many business students struggle with this mod, so it is very common to see people freeloading for the projects and weekly assignments. Thus, if you are the only one that is capable of doing the projects and assignments, you will end up doing them by yourself.",Neutral ,2,,,,,,,,,
Research proposal imo is one of the most important assignments for this mod becos its going to be kind of a guide/template for your final essay. Do find a topic that interests you becos something that gives u interest is likely going to encourage u to research deeper. Try going for consultations. The tutors do give it if requested and their advice on how to write the essay is going to be much more customised as compared to the syllabus stuff.,Neutral ,5,,,,,,,,,
is a really nice module to take but the workload requires you to be a bit consistent. The prof doesn't believe in force memorisation (so there's no finals) but there is some reflection to be written every week but it was one of the most meaningful modules I ever took + is a gem,Joy,9,,,,,,,,,
"This mod is light, kinda low commitment and not hard if you put some effort. I taken all 5 GE pillars and I can say this mod is the best in terms of workload besides the GEQ which is SU-able. Btw I scored quite well so I’m glad to chose this mod :) Btw the profs are engaging though hard to understand with a bit of Chinese accent. However you will be able to survive and score with the slides and the reading.",Joy,9,,,,,,,,,
"He is very passionate, and probably the kindest and nicest professor I’ve ever met. He will always try to brighten up your day, and you can really feel how much love he has for what he teaches. He is always willing to help you when you approach him. Despite the long list above, the workload is pretty light. There are no tests or essays. Don’t worry too much about remembering all the details taught in lecture as you can always refer back to your notes. For team project, there are 2 presentations and one e-book. These will take up most of your time, but can be done fairly quickly. They don’t require too much time and energy either. For the individual work, the weekly reflective learning assignment will take up most of your time, but if you diligently do them every week, you won’t feel them at all. The reviews and quizzes are done either during lecture or after, and are open book (for quizzes). In fact, Prof Lam encourages you to do the quizzes while checking your notes.",Joy,10,,,,,,,,,
"The workload for this module is pretty light, and lectures are mostly there to brush up on your general knowledge regarding biodiversity. Dr. Ng and Dr. Choong both deliver content verbally, while their slides often consist only of one image along with a title/caption. There is no webcast, so listening is key, as whatever the lecturers say could come out on the test/exam. There are also no tutorials, instead being replaced by more lectures.",Neutral ,8,,,,,,,,,
"Relatively chill mod and MCQ finals and midterms. 1 grp project that requires you and your group to go for a walk in one of the nature parks in SG(depends on what question you get). I did this mod last sem so it was an open book open universe exam. The power of Google probably hard carried my ass for this mod. I put in some effort but never had intense studying sessions for it, because well, it is an open universe exam. Got an A for this mod.",Neutral ,10,,,,,,,,,
"Takes the top place as my favourite mod in NUS. Prof Stella is stellar at teaching this module, not to mention that the contents are super interesting. If you have watched police/detective/law dramas I highly recommend this mod. There is a test every 2 to 3 weeks at the end of the lectures but it is relatively easy as long as you follow through the lecture. Downside is that it is a 7 to 9 plus lecture (the slot is 6 to 10) and not webcasted. I got pretty high for all the tests but screwed up my midterms, which was a one page report. Got a B+ in the end but I really liked the mod.",Joy,10,,,,,,,,,
"quite nice. One tutorial every 2 weeks (make sure to contribute a bit to class discussion). You don’t need to attend a single lecture to contribute to the class, the tutor usually asks about personal experiences. One group essay (I think around 1200 words per person) and a book review. Everyone I know got an A or A-.",Joy,9,,,,,,,,,
"the prof was super passionate which makes it really fun! Workload was pretty light imo too, didn't have to do much studying, just referred to notes when necessary and got an A+ in the end (many people I know scored well in the mod)",Joy,9,,,,,,,,,
"It was quite slack, just sharing answers to tutorial questions given beforehand. The class participation portion is quite competitive however. I found it a bit of a waste of time tbh. The workload was just one news report and one essay. The news report was analysing a news article and applying what whatever learnt to explain the article. For the essay, the Prof gave 5 very broad themes and we could write anything within the theme. The only complaint I have was that the essay was pretty time-consumung cus the word limit was 3.5k. So yeah overall it was quite a slack mod haha, the content and readings are v manageable as well!",Neutral ,8,,,,,,,,,
"This module is designed in a way that allows students to focus on themes of their preference to do their assignments. So if you are self-disciplined and keen on delving deep into some particular topics introduced in each lecture, you are good to go. Would say it's pretty chill, I didn't do any of the readings except for those I'm writing for class responses. Tutorial also don't require much preparation and lecture is pretty engaging - Dr Carl is not too bad of a lecturer if you're interested in politics!",Neutral ,7,,,,,,,,,
Content was somewhat interesting but I stopped watching after the first week. Went into the exams somewhat blind and just Googled on the spot since it was open-internet too. Good module to take in Y1 to SU. Honestly quite interesting and the professor Dr John van Wyhe was extremely passionate and knowledgeable,Neutral ,9,,,,,,,,,
coz 100% continual assessment and no final exam (syllabus changes from time to time so no guarantees its the same everytime). Actually the mod was quite easy to score in my opinion coz the weekly quizzes (20%) were legit Control + F from the readings. And the final essay you could write anything you want as long as its related to Asia and History. Honestly would recommend this mod.,Neutral ,8,,,,,,,,,
"has quite a bit of jargon and specific definitions for certain terms. these are quite important for tests but are not too difficult because the prof does provide a glossary and a lot of guidance. there are also essay components about global issues which can naturally be analyzed in multiple perspectives, so if you are good at writing it will be easy to do well there. i took it because it sounded interesting and overlaps with soci quite a bit; the prof who teaches it is from the soci dept. if that appeals to you then i would recommend it.",Neutral ,5,,,,,,,,,
"is fun if you want to try out acting, but the workload is quite heavy, especially the theory portion but the professors are all very experienced.",Sad,5,,,,,,,,,
is really an easy module. Just have to watch movies and proactively participate in the tutorial. Exam questions are straightforward too.,Neutral ,7,,,,,,,,,
"The module was interesting! You will be attached to a mentor whom will guide your group through the process of writing the research paper. It’s a unique experience and it will give you an insight of how the curriculum is like in dukenus. You might struggle a little with the concepts but right from the start of the module, we had some ice breakers as a class and set some ground rules within our groups that we always ask if unsure, and always help if you are able to clarify the doubt :)",Joy,7,,,,,,,,,
"it’s a p chill mod. No math, no coding, no tut haha. It’s graded on quizzes and grp proj. Good mod to take If u wan overload :)",Joy,9,,,,,,,,,
"Most (~70%) of the quiz questions are fluff, where you can ctrl+f the textbook for the answer. It got worse/better (depends on each person) in the second half of the semester where he straight up gave free marks for choosing yes at least once per week, sometimes even twice. Some of them are tricky though, felt like he was testing observation skills instead as he would just change a word to see if you realise it. Bellcurve is kinda steep. Personally I got an A with 91 while someone on nusmods got a B+ with 87.",Sad,4,,,,,,,,,
"I am terribly worried about getting an F again. The thought of getting an F again is haunting me almost everyday... Can't believe i cant even handle a 1k mod. All the posts about people struggling badly this sem too makes me just wanna cry not knowing whats waiting for me next sem. I know i sound like a loser but I just suck at coding. I don't think anyone would have taken the same mod 3 times but I dont wanna be the first one to do that. My cap rn is about 3.6 which is not good either. I want to do better next sem, Im planning to start studying for CS1010E right after this sem's finals are over. But I feel like CS is really a skill that is just not for everyone 😢😢 I really don't want to get an F one more time for the exact same mod, it will crush my self-esteem by a lot... I'm sure there will be people replying to this saying i'm just whining and im such a loser...",Fear,1,,,,,,,,,
"pretty chill mod, mcq for midterm and final, no projects, tutorials whatsoever, just listen to the lectures carefully and read the weekly readings (not a lot) can liao. And the prof is absolutely great at teaching and engaging students",Neutral ,10,,,,,,,,,
"best mod I have taken, extremely chill and really interesting, u get to learn stuff like how being born in earlier months is considered luckier and whether we actually have free will. Bell curve not that bad and exams were not too difficult.",Joy,10,,,,,,,,,
"introduces you to a whole new side of mathematics that you probably have never seen before up till now, and it will give you a brief glimpse of whether you will be enjoying mathematics in university. Both are great professors whom I have taken modules under.",Neutral ,8,,,,,,,,,
"Tbh cs1231 was a little disappointing and a lot less rigorous than what my friends were doing in ma1100; exam questions were more about ""how fast can you think of a solution to this"" rather than in-depth proofs. My final exam had like only 20 marks proof-based out of 100. Neither has much of a workload other than understanding the content tbh",Sad,4,,,,,,,,,
has been the best mod I've taken. The prof is actually really great and I sometimes look forward to the pre recorded lectures. It has been more enjoyable than I expected. The assessment also seems pretty fair and isn't bogged down by convoluted proctoring procedures like most mods.,Joy,10,,,,,,,,,
"im not a v outspoken person so presentations being online this sem were rly helpful since i didnt feel as pressurised or anxious + my group prepared a script beforehand so we basically js read of our scripts HAHA tbh i feel that how well you do is also dependent on the topic you get for the presentation. i got housing, family & education which was imo easier to present compared to law per se. all the topics are v interesting nonetheless! i rly didnt say much during tutorials which was horrible on my part but meisen does a rly good job at providing us with different perspectives of things & also knowing when to chime in while still giving us ample room to speak!!",Neutral ,10,,,,,,,,,
"Those were some of the best mods i have ever taken, fun and interactive. Lecturer and Tutors were all encouraging and supportive. Jumping is fairly easy - just need to go for a short chat with the teacher(s). They will try to place you in the right class as long as you honestly represent your abilities during the chat. As far as grades go, i think its difficult to get anything A- and above (unless you really devote your effort to mastering the language, but chances are you have your core modules to worry about). There are occasionally smurfs (people who are already good at the language but pretend they are not) which can make the bell curve kinda difficult, but as long as you do your due diligence, you should not do too badly :D",Joy,9,,,,,,,,,
"it defers from person to person. I got median grades for and i’d spend about 2-4 hours on it everyday if i averaged everything out. Which is ridiculous but i had close to no experience in programming beforehand, so i had to put in the hours. Keep in mind that a good part of  is problem solving (akin to puzzles), so you can go into a mission and finish it in 1 hour (the proudest moment of my life) or spend close to 3 hours for the next 3 days doing it (this was my worst, it was a mission to do with music and sound) It just depends on if you see the solution or not. I’d say i’m the average CS kid in NUS, so as long as you put in the hours and grasp concepts well, you will get Bs no problem. But if you want As, get ready to put in double the work :P (i decided it was not worth it, especially since just one exam can easily cost you your A)",Neutral ,5,,,,,,,,,
"MCs wise, a normal mod is about 4 MCs. The higher the MC for a mod, the more workload said mod has. So when I say 8 MC, i mean to treat as 2 mods worth of workload. But you have to try it to understand it. This is one of those things that depends on your load management and your focus.",Neutral ,4,,,,,,,,,
content sounds really interesting but the 8am lectures really ain't it and I didn't really get the point of the 45 min pre-lecture engagement honestly... Some of the lectures were really interesting tho I liked the AI one. The quiz can discuss/check Tele so not that hard to score well and honestly the grading system for this mod is q lenient as it's 50% quiz 50% class part/presentation so there's no essays or finals,Neutral ,6,,,,,,,,,
content was rlly interesting (except Gilgamesh) and profs were really engaging/entertaining. The quiz is q confusing sometimes but can discuss/check Tele so not that hard to score well (or at least average). The final take home assignment was also q fun as it grades how well u understand and apply the concepts to Ur everyday life,Joy,7,,,,,,,,,
"content was ok for me as a science student (although the scientific content might put off those from the arts). It's mainly on climate change which is q interesting given the recent impacts and awareness on climate change(extreme weather events, SG2030 etc) block tests were q challenging imo esp since there's no time to discuss but workshops and exploratariums were q fun.",Neutral ,6,,,,,,,,,
"content was fairly interesting, but it felt like they were milking ideas out of u as u have to think of 10 ideas for this then 10 ideas to improve etc. Tutorials were q fun although the time given for the tut activities were q less. Also the grading for the segments are kinda iffy as it feels like writing more = scoring better, even if the ideas I wrote made no sense or were beating around the bush. I gave up at the prototype section...",Neutral ,4,,,,,,,,,
"I have to say... I don't think this is really true personally? I got 2/4 EEs so far (other 2 MEs) and I didn't feel like I had to put in an absurd amount of effort for it. I didn't even talk to anybody about the mod outside of working in groups in tutorials. The ILAs are designed for MAX 3h-4 of work every 2 weeks and the tutorials are really just fill in the blank. Everything here is made as easy as possible for what they want to teach. Also, they're literally just holding our hands through this. They keep describing in almost painful detail the framework and approaches to design thinking and shit. You don't need experience in design to be able to understand what they're saying. The benefit of being a common mod is that the majority of people don't know what's going on either. You're not at a disadvantage for not having prior experience. I'll be honest I don't know how they grade things, but I think it's fair to assume (from what I've done) that if you just vomit out something that sounds smart it'll be better than just putting something average and generic. The reflection questions sound like CCE classes or whatever student leadership things in sec sch/jc where they try to make you explain why something was good. I'm not complaining because it's pretty low effort.",Anger,7,,,,,,,,,
"was a fun mod, prof GG is a great teacher that had to make do with the lack of response in zoom lectures, overall content is interesting and makes u think abt the role of luck in life. Readings are average for a GE/arts mod, exams are based on core concepts found in the readings. Not particularly difficult unless one is trying for A, which requires a deeper understanding of how the concepts were applied and which are used in which context. Would recommend regardless as a GE/UE",Joy,6,,,,,,,,,
"Structure is very very light, one recorded lecture, notes, and reading per week. 10 quizzes of mcq ONLY. Tutorial (1hr) requires little prep besides the lecture. 20% easy class part if u just try. The quizzes are rather simple. Make sure to discuss w/ peers and if you have a strong command of english you're good to go. On average I barely spend any time on this mod because lectures can be watched at 2x speed. If you're planning on taking logic and philo i assume you should be strong enough to understand both modules concepts covered.",Neutral ,9,,,,,,,,,
"i did not watch any lecture videos, skipped a tutorial session (worth 6%), on average got ~3 out of 6% for the 6 quizzes as i did them blindly and still passed the mod. Not sure what’s the grading like for this semester but if it’s the same as before, make sure you at least try in the forum posts and participate in the tutorials. The tutors don’t want to fail you anyway, so the bare minimum is enough.",Neutral ,5,,,,,,,,,
"It’s not a hard mod, but the assessment requirements are rlly bleh and not explained vv well. As an example you have to design a poster abt a public health problem, and it’s group work. You can’t choose your group mates so it’s a lottery, and if you’re not artistically talented or have a group mate that is you’re gonna struggle to do better than average for this. It’s an interesting mod for sure, and workload is indeed manageable if you’re looking for a mod to SU, but it rlly is not easy to do well in it :/",Anger,4,,,,,,,,,
"is well liked cause the prof is great, and the midterms/finals are MCQ. If you’re okay with lots of readings, and you like the topic, you’ll love this mod. That being said, MCQ assessments means the bell curve can be tough, but it’s def easier (imo) to do well in this mod",Joy,8,,,,,,,,,
"It was fun but like someone else said, language mods tend to have competitive bellcurves. this is especially tougher if your classmates alr have some form of fluency in the language beforehand (there are a number of them in every language mod). also, the jump of difficulty from level 1 to level 2 and each subsequent level tbh, at least for me and some of my classmates, was quite a leap so that took consistent adjusting every sem and keeping myself in check. imo, my language mods were the mods i had to make sure i put consistent weekly effort in compared to other normal mods where i could afford to maybe miss one reading and catch up another time!! overall, i definitely performed much better CAP wise in my GEMs, but still don’t regret taking malay bcos it made me grow an appreciation and interest in it",Neutral ,5,,,,,,,,,
I can easily say that it is the most useful or fun mod I’ve taken in NUS (biz student here doing double maj in BZA). The rumors u heard are prob true. It is extremely tough and the workload is insane.. the amount of missions and side quests (term for assignments) to complete will be a culture shock to most people. However it is like bitter medicine. Consistency is key and this mod requires a lot of hard work!! I would encourage anybody looking for a useful UE to clear to go for it. The prof and tutors are also extremely helpful.,Fear,8,,,,,,,,,
"Probably the most fun mod I've taken in NUS so far. Did this pre-covid, so really not sure how the module is conducted under e-learning formats. Lectures are interesting you get to learn how different people and groups develop their music and culture. Tutorials are weekly sessions where you get to learn and play music from different cultures and countries. (Sundanese, Balinese gamelan, south Indian music, African music) The tutorials are extremely fun and chill with no prep work needed. I strongly recommend taking pictures and videos of your playing and the instruments. Workload is really really light, consisting of weekly journal updates on tutorial sessions, 2 concert reports (1 for each half sem) and a group presentation on local music etc.",Joy,10,,,,,,,,,
"It was really a really fun mod going through the different topics in philosophy and uses a lot of logical reasoning. Workload wise it was pretty manageable, just got to finish a weekly MCQ quiz and there is an MCQ exam. Despite being mcq it can be kinda tricky because the small nuances in the phrasing really affects the answer, but still quite doable. I am from SoC but I wouldn't say i felt disadvantaged taking the mod. In fact, taking a mod that touched on some logic (CS1231) certainly helped me grasp some of the arguments faster.",Joy,9,,,,,,,,,
"He might be in the industry, but he is bad at teaching from what I heard from most people who took the course. Also, since he is a part timer, his classes are all on Friday, and I heard he has a tendency to cancel classes at the very last minute, like 1-2 hours before his class. Also, grades for this module is kinda bad, most people get B whether they did good or bad and that is the most common grade. I personally have not taken this course but after all the bad reviews I heard from those who took it I have no intention of taking it.",,1,,,,,,,,,
"Managed to get A despite getting average scores for both midterms. ( IIRC average were 17% and 18% out of 25% respectively for each midterms) Midterms were purely online when I took it, no lockdown browser and no zoom. Can refer to notes la, but the options were pretty tricky like Yes/No/Maybe/Sometimes. For final exam, they will just give you a scenario and you have to analyse from there to answer the question. I would say take it if you have the interest and can analyse or think out of the box.",,6,,,,,,,,,
"Personally, it was a nice and easy module that had a fun prof ng bing feng. There were 2 other profs that were not as fun but the content was still pretty manageable. Even though I hadn’t exercised my brain for the past 2 yrs due to NS it was all gucci UWU XD. TLDR: ez version of y3 aero mods with fun prof 10/10 would recommend",,8,,,,,,,,,
"There are no assignments! In terms of class participation, before lessons were shifted to be online, it was the typical class participation style whereby one can raise their hands to share their opinions. However, after lessons were turned towards an online classroom setting, it became ‘fastest fingers first’ whereby one had to click the quickest to participate in the lesson. It could be more stressful as you would have to compete with your classmates for class participation, however, some may find it more comfortable to share given that we were not obligated to show our faces on the cameras throughout the lesson.",,4,,,,,,,,,
"is extremely professional and is rather strict, in the sense whereby she is not afraid to call you out if your opinion is not well validated. I enjoy her lessons as she questions the opinions made by our fellow classmates, so it kinds of eliminates baseless opinions that may occur in class participation.",,7,,,,,,,,,
"However, I would say that her time teaching is often compromised by how long the case study presentations take (every lesson, there are usually 1 or 2 starting from Week 4) and this resulted in her rushing through her slides as she does not want us to be held back for lessons. I would rather much prefer if she went through in detail rather than rushing through :’)",,3,,,,,,,,,
"There are 2 group presentations which are rather intensive, so if you are taking this module under her, be prepared to be overloaded!",,2,,,,,,,,,
is manageable in terms of difficulty as well but there are a lot of contents to consume. The labs are rather easy and can be completed within 3 hrs.,,9,,,,,,,,,
Be prepared for a graded component every 2-3 weeks. There are like 5 CAs in total and around 3 of them involve grpwork. Not so chill for a communication module even if you want to SU. Definitely much chiller than 2030 and 2040 though.,,4,,,,,,,,,
"is a rather interesting mod, where you get to learn more about bits, logic gates and low level stuff. If you’re interested in them, there shouldn’t be an issue scoring well in this mod.",,10,,,,,,,,,
"They emphasise more on the principles of OOP rather than making you solve difficult problems. If you love learning a new language, also shouldn’t be a problem. (Also not a problem if you did ace 1101).",,9,,,,,,,,,
"If you’re generally an extrovert, you’ll do quite well. But workload is bloody high, too high for a non-CS module (or at least that’s what I think). There’s 3 group presentations, 1 impromptu speech and 1 final essay. The group presentations took up a lot of hours, and our efforts didn’t translate as the tutors mark really strictly. However, this is coming from an introvert who really hates communicating and came into the mod with the intention to SU. Ended up getting a B btw.",,2,,,,,,,,,
I feel that 2660 is a mod that you’ll still need to put in a relative amount of effort in order to SU (at least that’s what I think). You might be better off taking your GE mod!,,3,,,,,,,,,
"It generally went quite well since it started off with familiar topics like differentiation, integration. Then, things got a little tougher when it came to partial differentiation & double integration (my math isn’t that great). Why I say it might be different as compared to other sems is mainly because COVID struck halfway throughout the sem. Then, prof gave take home assignments (which everyone scored v v well, essentially rendering it useless). Finals was done in luminus quiz with just ONE box to indicate your final answer (no method mark), and questions were MUCH MUCH more difficult compared to the previous sems (perhaps to balance the curve from the assignments).",,5,,,,,,,,,
"I really enjoyed this module as the discussions were centered around tech issues. However, the tasks can be very time consuming. If your group mates are not Y1s and not intending to SU the module while you plan to do ao, it can also lead to conflict. However, if you're a good communicator, it's a pretty straightforward module. I scraped by with an A- despite not doing any non-project prep work.",,7,,,,,,,,,
"Personally, I've only ever taken CS2030, so my experience may vary. However, if you have a strong understanding of java/OOP, this is a fairly straightforward mod. As long as you keep up with the labs and projects (which is what takes up the most time) you should be fine.",,8,,,,,,,,,
"Wow I really struggled w this mod personally. However, since you're taking this the second time, you should be fine!",,3,,,,,,,,,
"I've heard from friends taking this mod online that having friends to take the mod with is very important, so do keep that in consideration. At the same time, a large chunk of it IS jc math, so if you have a strong math foundation maybe you'll do fine? Took this mod offline so maybe a lot has changed since then.",,5,,,,,,,,,
"One of my favourite mods, might be challenging to pick up C/MIPS while learning Java for CS2030. At the same time, I think it was def easier and less time consuming than CS2040S.",,8,,,,,,,,,

is a blessing for any student who studies under her. She is really warm and kind-hearted and not to mention a terrific educator who cares about her students understanding and education.,,10,,,,,,,,,
They had taken time and effort to explain concepts and answer my questions after classes and sometimes through email. Most of them also advised me one way or another through my undergraduate course.,,8,,,,,,,,,
"That prof is a god-send, he explains all the concepts to the best of his ability, and make sure that everyone is as engaged as possible. He is super passionate in his domain, and always shares interesting concepts or proofs as to give a complete picture.",,10,,,,,,,,,
"Both of them are super passionate about CS, and go to great lengths to make sure the course material is understood well :)",,9,,,,,,,,,
Very knowledgeable and always willing to help students with questions after lectures/consults! Best part is he dosent speak slowly so I wont zone out easily,,10,,,,,,,,,
"Explains concepts very clearly and well, friendly and approachable for questions/consultations. Felt that he speaks abit slowly BUT X2 speed and it's all good",,9,,,,,,,,,
"only CHS mod that was enjoyable, felt that prof Loy was very cheerful and engaging during lectures",,8,,,,,,,,,
He single handedly taught every tutorial for a cohort of >700 students with the same enthusiasm and passion for every session. Was also quick with replies and interacted alot with his students (thru email etc). I rmb emailing him about my grades and received a reply in less than 5 mins along with some words of encouragement. A pity that some students took his kindness for granted and cheated in the tests even after his repeated warnings to not do so.,,9,,,,,,,,,
"I heard lots of scary things about the mod from friends who were under other profs but my friends and I really enjoyed the way she taught. Extremely clear, doesn't assume prior knowledge and she even gave advice on how to study for the mod after my cohort performed slightly lackluster during midterms.",,7,,,,,,,,,
"The module was quite tough with its midterms and finals but that’s nothing new for econs mods. I think prof teaching was incredibly effective, great professor to learn and take under",,7,,,,,,,,,
She is really good in teaching and explains concepts in such an amazing way that it is easy to understand. I was really motivated to do well for her module and it really sparked my interest in Microeconomics. She also has a good sense of humour,,9,,,,,,,,,
probably one of the most enthu and hyper profs who loves what he does.,,10,,,,,,,,,
He really cares for his students. Always very kind and willing to help a struggling student like myself.,,8,,,,,,,,,
She has a bit of a motherly instinct and always helps her students with sound advice and answers to our queries.,,9,,,,,,,,,
"Very patient and knowledgeable, always willing to help students.",,10,,,,,,,,,
"Absolutely, he is clear and concise about the content that he teaches and only teaches stuff that is beneficial to the students not just for the sake of covering content. she teaches very well and also very helpful.",,10,,,,,,,,,
One of the worst mods and worst prof. Would recommend anyone to take it if you like self harm,,1,,,,,,,,,

Everyone else can do it what, why not you! Cry for an hour and then just continue. Too many assignments, too many tests, and group project mates that I can't pull down just because of my stupid inability to just do it. I'm so sick and so sick of this and the worst thing is it'll never end.",,1,,,,,,,,,

"honestly it's draining. Been taking the initiative since the start to pitch ideas and try to know them better and they act like you owe them money. It just so happened to be one of those ""lousy"" groupings where more than one person is irritating. Didn't have high expectations anyway but then they make project decisions on their own without bothering to discuss with anyone, so it benefits their own portion.",,1,,,,,,,,,
"Even worse, when you are already stressed out from other stuff, then every time go class you just get more negative. This single mod where I had to work with bad teammates became one of my worst memory of uni life.",,2,,,,,,,,,
"OMG, i think I might just be an offender. In my case, it's mostly unresponsive groupmates. Like I wanna chill and let my groupmates share the burden, but no one bothers and I get single word responses, so I find myself generally taking aggressive measures frequently.",,3,,,,,,,,,
"I honestly feel that it was the worst maths module I have ever taken. The entirety was pre-recorded videos with horrible audio quality. Audio quality aside, pre-recorded videos means that we cannot ask questions when we do not understand something.",,1,,,,,,,,,
"Extremely dry, and for topics like integration, shows the formula but not how it is applicable to real life scenarios. Therefore everything feels like ""I can solve this paper question, but have no idea how to apply it to life."" Luckily, with the help of youtube, google and a physics mod I am taking, I managed to figure out what integration is for, other then solving made up equations on paper.",,3,,,,,,,,,
Lecturer has never shown up once for anything. Shoutout to the TAs who host consultations. Questions asked via email are often replied with 1-liners that offer little to no explanation and may take days to get a reply. Really just feels like lecturer doesn't care.,,2,,,,,,,,,
has been the best mod I've taken. The prof is actually really great and I sometimes look forward to the pre recorded lectures. It has been more enjoyable than I expected. The assessment also seems pretty fair and isn't bogged down by convoluted proctoring procedures like most mods.,,9,,,,,,,,,
"is extremely important, arguably the most important module in your entire CS life, so I would put a lot of focus on it.",,5,,,,,,,,,
"alone is already a very heavy commitment mod (feels like a 12-20 MC mod to many who have taken it), so yes taking 29 MCs may not be very advisable unless you are highly confident you can manage them all well if you have sufficient time to revise, or if you do not have much extracurricular commitments.",,4,,,,,,,,,
"is much harder than the normal iteration (duh since it's S-coded). Despite just differing from 1MC the workload is definitely a few times much higher than the normal version. Problem sets/tutorials are given every week and they are very time-consuming even for the brightest of minds. By time consuming I mean you can practically spend days just pondering upon one tutorial question. And since it's under CCW, this difficulty will definitely be amplified (yes the notorious CCW).",,2,,,,,,,,,
"This mod super dry and workload super heavy cks every tutorial need give presentation, maciam biz school don't take this module",,1,,,,,,,,,
"overall i think the module was pretty chill. The mod covers a broad scope of topics ranging from things like globalisation, drug trafficking, international education etc. Iirc you only need to do weekly forum posting on relevant topics, 1 midterm MCQ and one paper on any topic discussed that you can do as an individual or as a pair.",,6,,,,,,,,,
"The module is quite chill in general, as there was only one midterm exam. The midterm exam covered topics taught before recess week, and were all mcq. Attendance were taken for lectures, in the form of a short quiz after each lesson. However, the lectures after the midterm were not examinable, so you can choose to zone out during the lecture.",,6,,,,,,,,,
"Lastly, there were tutorials held every fortnightly, conducted by the TAs. Each TA has their own style of running their tutorial classes. For mine, the TA would send us a list of readings/videos to prepare beforehand, and she grades our tutorial participation based on attendance and how much you contribute during the class discussion.",,5,,,,,,,,,
Not sure about my finals score but my midterms was 44/50 but still got an A at the end. Cheating is an option (which i didnt cause i did not have any friends taking with me) but honestly i don't think it matters unless someone u're cheating with has supreme knowledge on the content,,4,,,,,,,,,
"For this mod i dont think cheating is a huge problem, the prof is good at setting questions. most of them you can't really find answer even with google.",,6,,,,,,,,,
"One thing u should consider is the 25th and 75th percentile of the module too. For B+ generally 65 percentile is quite a safe value to use as a gauge. Since the midterms 25th percentile is 30 and 75th percentile is 39 marks, you can roughly estimate that you’ll need 7 more marks than the median to get to 65th percentile (assuming its 36/50 and same spread for finals). That means u must score a 43/50. So if u think u cant hit 40++, the chance of ur B+ will diminish greatly. Ofc this is an estimation which may not hold true, but I have observed this from many of my friends who have taken darwin across diff sems (im y4 now haha)",,5,,,,,,,,,
It was actually really nice since I no longer had to record the prof during physical lectures in case I missed out something important. I don’t think the bell curve was too bad since I took this mod with a friend and we both got As. Overall a chill mod and the plus point is definitely the prof nice voice.,,6,,,,,,,,,
It's a great mod with an amazing prof! All lectures are live and recorded hence you can watch them in your own time. It is a chill mod and is made up of a 50 mcq midterm and finals,,8,,,,,,,,,
"I was so sad when this mod came to an end BECAUSE ITS SO INTERESTING. But I have to warn you it’s quite content heavy and relies v heavily on memory work. The prof is super engaging but his slides can be minimal, so you really need to take notes of whatever he says. Most people I know that took this mod scored quite well so I don think the bell curve is that bad. (I managed to get A+) Since the lectures were recorded it’s even better cuz you can just playback if you didn’t catch what he said.",,7,,,,,,,,,
I think in order to get an A you must know way beyond simple facts that you can simply check in exam :) the bell curve ended up being a lot less steep than expected imo and i did q well in the mod. i was defo far from a perfect score,,6,,,,,,,,,
"i thoroughly enjoyed it - but i think the approach one needs to take w this mod is q social-sciencey (it is after all a history of sci mod) in that you have to pay attention to shifting tides of opinions/ consensus on how one views the world and science, the construction of the rift between science and religion, the médiatization and politicization of sci etc.",,7,,,,,,,,,
is pretty low workload so overloading is reasonable BUT 1k language can be very time consuming esp if u not looking to su/learn properly so it really depends how you think you would cope.,,4,,,,,,,,,
"quite fun and informative, lectures were basically the prof just telling stories to explain the concept. It’s once a week 3hr lecture but when I took in in Sem 1, there were only like 4/5 live lectures that lasted approx 1.5hrs that was an extension of the content taught. Lecture content was prerecorded lectures from 19/20 sem.",,6,,,,,,,,,
There’s a 5 person grp report and presentation but you can form your own grps so best if you take the mod with a few friends so it’s easier in that aspect. Also 2 homework worth 5% each that was quite okay as it’s covered sufficiently/able to Google to check if the answer you got was correct.,,6,,,,,,,,,
"i enjoyed it a lot! the content was v interesting to me, to see how logical rules (which i learned in maths/cs) applied to linguistics. if you're interested in these two areas, i highly recommend.",,7,,,,,,,,,
was pretty interesting even though heavy on readings. I found the content to be worth reading and learned quite a bit.,,5,,,,,,,,,
If you want to get A you need to work hard because this mod is super content heavy and close book. Easy A cannot be used to describe this mod unless you learned about brain beforehand.,,3,,,,,,,,,
"Would say the content can be difficult/heavy if you don’t have any background in bio/neuro, but there’re q a few guest lectures which won’t be tested & the assessments were q manageable.",,4,,,,,,,,,
"Content is interesting, more about behavioral economics rather than our typical diagrams and theories, but don't take it if you don't enjoy reading - there are 2-3 readings per week, and can add up to over 100 pages in total.",,5,,,,,,,,,
"This module is tough, not going to lie. You need the tenacity and grit to churn out 5 mini-essays in 1 hour for the midterms (6 marks for each mini-essay) and 2 hours for the finals - 6 essays (worth between 6 to 15 marks - totalling 63 marks approximately).",,2,,,,,,,,,
"Bell-curve is hard to beat for most GE modules, that being said, you would definitely have a blast from learning and reading.",,5,,,,,,,,,
"I was overloading but I felt this module was a good break from my core modules. The first half of the module has less intensive and more intuitive concepts. The second half has more hard-to-understand concepts, but it is still very manageable.",,6,,,,,,,,,
"I feel that as long as you do your work consistently, you should be able to attain a good grade. I skipped revision of one chapter for the finals as I procrastinated my readings... but still managed to get an A miraculously. I honestly don’t think the bell curve is steep (from the tutorial, seems like most people don’t even read the readings lol) so just give it a shot!",,8,,,,,,,,,
"Honestly, it's a pretty interesting mod, however if you don't like writing, you shouldn't take it. The module is mostly about writing, with 6 essays(thematic summary mostly but also some other choices for you to choose from) around 1000 words. I think the stories/papers are interesting albeit I didn't read some of them.",,6,,,,,,,,,
"The writing portion is kinda ok-ish(?) to score. You definitely need to put in some effort, I usually write them on weekends/when I have more time to do some research on some topic.",,5,,,,,,,,,
The prof gives interesting lectures and has a really fun personality. I find him one of the most engaging profs I've met as all his lectures are interesting. Usually there is a 1 on 1 session with the prof(for 20/21 Sem 1 it's like 3-4 ppl though) is a fun experience.,,7,,,,,,,,,
"I honestly felt like the paper would've been much better if it were just a paper exam rather than being on examplify. I mean, they already had all of us in-person? That way it would be a lot easier to write our working down on the qn paper straight rather than having to partition the already small lecture table into two to have space to do working on the draft paper.",,3,,,,,,,,,
is fucking rubbish anyway. It's a shitty mod that knocks you down 1 grade for 1 wrong mcq question. Worse of all the mcq questions are vague as fuck. Not worth the stress if you're just a Y1.,,1,,,,,,,,,
I'm so done... The super steep bell curve just makes it difficult to even score a B+. I'm just gonna S/U this.,,2,,,,,,,,,
"I am drowning in assignments, labs, and exams with my deteriorating mental health, my brain now being as stable as swiss cheese. I literally have -- not even like no friends, no acquaintances to talk to -- like no being to talk to other than one other person who I've been friends with in JC. I literally have no time to join CCAs, any clubs.",,1,,,,,,,,,
I have been feeling very tensed/worried about my progress in Uni. Last semester (my second semester in Uni as I am a Y1) was hard on me- I was dealing with the recent and sudden death of a parent + general covid stress + personal anxiety of staying in the local setting when I was prepared to go abroad (long story).,,1,,,,,,,,,
"I was already trying my best in school and even chose a major that I felt I could cope with as it arguably has quite a manageable workload compared to the other ones (I'm from FASS, not going to say which major bcos it might ruffle some feathers). I went to school, did the work, tried to focus, but was always very distracted and bothered by thoughts of the recent happenings.",,3,,,,,,,,,
"The range of workloads for TAs ranges from almost nothing to practically a full module on its own. Also depends on how “good” of a TA you aim to be, adjusting for your own prepared materials, responding to student messages/emails, and how detailed and thorough you want to be in grading. Check with the existing TAs for the specific mod you have in mind, these expectations tend to vary widely. But in any case, it should be manageable. My worst semester was a 32MC + 1TA mod semester. Wasn’t fun, but lived to tell the tale",,4,,,,,,,,,
"The group work communication thing is not normal, you might have had a bit of bad luck getting uncommunicative members :/ I’ve had my fair share of such groups especially when grouping with strangers who just ignore your messages, just don’t be afraid to voice out and kinda lowkey mention “guys we should get this going” and suggest a meeting or something.",,2,,,,,,,,,
is tough as hell cause assignments can eat up a lot of your time. I was in your position last sem but you just sort of have to let go a little bit and also get comfortable with always having tons of work.,,3,,,,,,,,,
"As this module is my biggest struggle, I've been putting in a lot of effort trying to understand and grasp the concepts. I've also consulted my TA and friends, they were really nice to help me. In fact, I usually spend the bulk of my weekends on this mod that I feel I neglected my other mods. Needless to say, I feel horrible but ironically, I did better in my other modules compared to this that I spent so much time on hahaha.",,4,,,,,,,,,
"I understand what you're going through. I do have my fair share of struggle in university and sometimes I do doubt my abilities. But at the end of the day, I usually tell myself that so long as I have already put in my best effort, it'll be good enough.",,4,,,,,,,,,
I feel more relieved. There is more group work and I get to meet more cool and inspiring people. It also helps that I'm less shy and are more initiative in communicating with others.,,5,,,,,,,,,
"Honestly a really fun module that touches the different parts of philosophy, from ethics to religion and even about simulation. The module has weekly quizzes on the previous lecture and can be rather difficult to get full marks even though its MCQ. Exam is fully mcq with even more tricky questions. Since its MCQ, they often test for the most logical choice so you should be able to reason well.",,8,,,,,,,,,
"to get mindfucked by utter nonsense. u learn abt classical logic through the two main structures: L1 and L2. Using these, you learn what sentences are made of, the distinctions between validity, truths and soundness etc. you also touch abit of set theory and inductive reasoning (up to tutor).",,3,,,,,,,,,

"Structure is very very light, one recorded lecture, notes, and reading per week. 10 quizzes of mcq ONLY. Tutorial (1hr) requires little prep besides the lecture. 20% easy class part if u just try. The quizzes are rather simple. Make sure to discuss w/ peers and if you have a strong command of english you're good to go. On average I barely spend any time on this mod because lectures can be watched at 2x speed. If you're planning on taking logic and philo i assume you should be strong enough to understand both modules concepts covered.",,10,,,,,,,,,
I do think you could do really well in this mod! Engineering students are really good in math and would definitely have an advantage in picking up logic (which is easier than math). And the mod is quite basic too - you don't really need any background philo knowledge at all.,,8,,,,,,,,,
"But you should still attain a good grade if you are consistent and do well in the quizzes. In my semester, the final exam accounted for 50% of the grade and the rest came from class part, lecture quizzes, take home quizzes and a computerised test. For the take-home quizzes, you could always check your answers with a friend! I personally screwed up the finals but still managed to obtain a good grade! Best part is that the mod has an extremely light workload - it felt like 2 MCs. It's good to take if you are overloading in the sem!",,9,,,,,,,,,
"he was q funny and everything was rly interesting. tbf, i’m generally quite curious abt things and this mod was a rly good break from my main core mods, didn’t even feel like it was studying. aced most of the quizzes and walked out of the exam hall after an hour quite confidently and got an A overall. honestly v minimal effort needed for this mod but having interest abt philo concepts like ‘are we living in a simulation? is it okay to eat meat?’ would make your experience pretty enjoyable!",,10,,,,,,,,,
"It was really a really fun mod going through the different topics in philosophy and uses a lot of logical reasoning. Workload wise it was pretty manageable, just got to finish a weekly MCQ quiz and there is an MCQ exam. Despite being mcq it can be kinda tricky because the small nuances in the phrasing really affects the answer, but still quite doable. I am from SoC but I wouldn't say i felt disadvantaged taking the mod. In fact, taking a mod that touched on some logic (CS1231) certainly helped me grasp some of the arguments faster.",,9,,,,,,,,,
"im speechless i have no words to describe the pain and mental trauma i go through every time i do anything related to this mod 😐 the finance portion especially was quite confusing for someone with no knowledge of finance at all. the mod literally behaves like any soc mod and throws you into to deep end and expect you to learn how to swim to save yourself. fwiw, i took this mod last sem and i survived. this too shall pass and there are worse mods in your curriculum that you might need to face :/ stay strong and my dms are open if you wanna ask anything",,2,,,,,,,,,
Best prof I've ever had in MA dept for sure - really helpful when i reached out to him via email since it was covid sem. Also very kind as a person bc when I emailed after the grades were released to thank his effort and I learnt a lot he did reply and wished me the best in my future.,,10,,,,,,,,,
"is not controversial ah, but he is uber hardcore. He is giving u a world class uni education in a ""world class uni"", so we should be very grateful. I think he toned down, took that mod under him 2 sems ago, and I think he has a very strict one size fits all pedagogy. I won't say he is bad, he is caring and knows his stuff, but I can see why people dislike his methods. I was ok with it, went with the mentality of see how it works for me. Gotta say it didn't work so well for me lol. The pacman project (by Berkeley) was super fun though!",,4,,,,,,,,,
